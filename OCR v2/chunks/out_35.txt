Cortical influences on breathing

Because the cerebral cortex has connections with the respiratory centre, we can voluntarily alter our pattern of breathing. We can even refrain from breathing for a short time. This voluntary control is protective, enabling us to prevent water or irritating gases from entering the lungs. However, the ability to hold breath is limited by the buildup of carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions in the body. When CO2 and H+ concentrations rise to a certain level, neurons in the medullary respiratory centre are strongly stimulated, and nerve impulses travel along the phrenic and intercostal nerves to the inspiratory muscles, causing breathing to resume whether we want it to or not. It is not possible for small children to kill themselves simply by holding their breath, even though many have tried. If breath-holding leads to fainting, breathing resumes when consciousness is lost. Nerve impulses from the hypothalamus and limbic system also stimulate the respiratory centre, allowing emotional states to alter breathing as, for example, in laughing and crying.

Chemoreceptor regulation of breathing

Certain chemical stimuli modulate how rapidly and how deeply we breathe. The respiratory system functions to maintain proper levels of CO2 and O2 and is highly responsive to changes in these gases in body fluids. Chemoreceptors, sensory neurons that respond to chemicals, monitor these levels and provide input to the respiratory centre. Central chemoreceptors are located in or near the medulla oblongata and respond to changes in hydrogen ion concentration in cerebrospinal fluid. Peripheral chemoreceptors are located in the aortic bodies—clusters of chemoreceptors in the wall of the aorta—and in the carotid bodies, which are oval nodules in the walls of the left and right common carotid arteries where they divide into the internal and external carotid arteries. The chemoreceptors of the aortic bodies are located close to the aorta.
