The movements listed are reflexes, though some can be initiated voluntarily.

Respiratory muscle training for COPD patients

Obstructive disorders are broadly characterized by alterations to the conducting airways, increasing the resistance and making the rate of airflow difficult to achieve. In 2011â€“2012, the number of hospitalisations for COPD approached 60,000. Although deaths have reduced since the 1970s, there is an increased need to improve quality of life in those people now living longer. As airways narrow and the lungs become obstructed from ventilating the lungs, the effort to breathe, even at rest, can become laborious and difficult. Ventilation of the lungs requires basic principles of pressure and volume, and this work is greater for people with COPD due to the obstruction to airflow. Like any skeletal muscle, respiratory muscles are not protected from fatigue. Resistive breathing devices are used with the person in resting state, usually sitting down, and breathing through the mouthpiece. The effort required to inhale or exhale can be adjusted to target the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Studies in patients are now demonstrating that specific inspiratory and expiratory muscle training stimulates the respiratory muscle function. In COPD patients, the respiratory training effects underpin improved exercise tolerance and reduced effort of breathing. The impact of stronger and less fatigable respiratory muscles can potentially mean that people living with COPD can improve their quality of life and carry out more activities of daily living on their own.
