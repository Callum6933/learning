23.1 Respiratory system anatomy

Learning Objective 23.1: Describe the anatomical structure and function of the respiratory system components.

The respiratory system consists of the nose, pharynx (throat), larynx (voice box), trachea (windpipe), bronchi, and lungs. Its parts can be classified in two ways: structurally and functionally. Structurally, the system is divided into two parts: the upper respiratory system, which includes the nose, nasal cavity, pharynx, and associated structures; and the lower respiratory system, which includes the larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs. Functionally, it is divided into two zones: the conducting zone and the respiratory zone. The conducting zone comprises a series of interconnecting cavities and tubes both outside and within the lungs. It includes the nose, nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and terminal bronchioles, and its function is to filter, warm, and moisten air and conduct it into the lungs. The respiratory zone consists of tubes and tissues within the lungs where gas exchange occurs, including the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli, which are the main sites of gas exchange between air and blood.

Structures of the respiratory system

The upper respiratory system includes the nose, nasal cavity, pharynx, and associated structures; the lower respiratory system includes the larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs.

Functions of the Respiratory System
1. Provides for gas exchange: intake of O2 for delivery to body cells and removal of CO2 produced by body cells.
2. Helps regulate blood pH.
3. Contains receptors for the sense of smell, filters inspired air, produces vocal sounds (phonation), and excretes small amounts of water and heat.

Nose

The nose is a specialized organ at the entrance of the respiratory system that consists of a visible external portion and an internal portion inside the skull called the nasal cavity. The external nose is the portion visible on the face and is supported by a framework of bone and hyaline cartilage, covered with muscle and skin and lined by a mucous membrane. The bony framework is formed by the frontal bone, nasal bones, and maxillae. The cartilaginous framework consists of several pieces of hyaline cartilage connected to each other and to certain skull bones by fibrous connective tissue. The cartilaginous framework includes the septal nasal cartilage, which forms the anterior portion of the nasal septum; the lateral nasal cartilages inferior to the nasal bones; and the alar cartilages, which form part of the walls of the nostrils. Because it is made of pliable hyaline cartilage, the cartilaginous framework of the external nose is relatively flexible. On the undersurface of the external nose are two openings called the external nares, or nostrils. The interior structure continues inside the skull as the nasal cavity.
