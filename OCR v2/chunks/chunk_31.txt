oglobin for O and thus helps unload O, from haemoglobin. BPG is formed in red blood cells when they break down glucose to produce ATP in a process called glycolysis (described in section 25.3). When BPG combines with haemoglobin by binding to the terminal amino groups of the two beta globin chains, the haemoglobin binds O, less tightly at the haem group sites. The greater the level of BPG, the more O, is unloaded from haemoglobin. Certain hormones, such as thyroxine, human growth hormone, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and testosterone, increase the formation of BPG. The level of BPG also is higher in people living at higher altitudes. Oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curves showing the relationship of (a) pH and (b) Pco, to haemoglobin saturation at normal body temperature. As pH increases , decreases, O2 combines more tightly with haemoglobin, so that less is available to tissues. The broken lines emphasise these relationships. As pH decreases , increases, the affinity of haemoglobin for O2 declines, so less Oo combines with haemoglobin and more is available to tissues. 100 - High blood pH 100 + Low blood & < S gol (76) 5 gob Peo. 2 xe} £ 80+ 3 80+ 8 70- Normal blood pH S 70+ Normal blood os 6 60L (7.4) 5S 60L Poos c< 2 sob Low blood pH 5 sob High blood g 3S P, 2 40h (7.2) 5 4b | C2 oO = 30F 2 sob oO 1 Cc 1 : 20+ 8 204 ! 2 40 a toh 0 pe 0 pea 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Po, (mmHg) Po, (mmHg) (a) Effect of pH on affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen (b) Effect , on affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen QUESTION In comparison to the value when you are sitting, is the affinity of your haemoglobin for O, higher or lower when you are exercising?

Why? Oxygen affinity of foetal and adult haemoglobin Foetal haemoglobin (Hb-F) differs from adult haemoglobin (Hb-A) in structure and in its affinity for O. Hb-F has a higher affinity for O) because it binds BPG less strongly. Thus, when Po, is low, Hb-F can carry up to 30% more O, than maternal Hb-A (figure 23.21). As the maternal blood enters the placenta, O, is readily transferred to foetal blood. This is very important because the O, saturation in maternal blood in the placenta is quite low, and the foetus might suffer hypoxia were it not for the greater affinity of foetal haemoglobin for O).

CLINICAL CONNECTION Carbon monoxide poisoning Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless and odourless gas found in exhaust fumes from automobiles, gas furnaces and space heaters, and in tobacco smoke. It is a by- product of the combustion of carbon-containing materials such as coal, gas, and wood. CO binds to the haem group of haemoglobin, just as O, does, except that the binding of carbon monoxide to haemoglobin is over 200 times as strong as the binding of O, to haemoglobin. Thu
