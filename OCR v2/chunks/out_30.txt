At a partial pressure of 40 mmHg, a large percentage of oxygen is released from hemoglobin, delivering more oxygen to metabolically active tissues. Although PO2 is the most important factor determining the percent oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, several other factors influence the tightness with which hemoglobin binds oxygen. In effect, these factors shift the entire dissociation curve to the left (higher affinity) or to the right (lower affinity). The changing affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is another example of how homeostatic mechanisms adjust body activities to cellular needs. Each factor makes sense when you remember that metabolically active tissue cells require oxygen and produce acids, carbon dioxide, and heat as wastes.

The following four factors affect the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen:

1. Acidity (pH)
As acidity increases (pH decreases), the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen decreases, and oxygen dissociates more readily from hemoglobin. The main acids produced by metabolically active tissues are lactic acid and carbonic acid. When pH decreases, the entire oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve shifts to the right; at any given PO2, hemoglobin is less saturated with oxygen—a change known as the Bohr effect. The Bohr effect works both ways: an increase in hydrogen ions in the blood promotes oxygen unloading from hemoglobin, and the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin promotes unloading of hydrogen ions. Hemoglobin can buffer hydrogen ions, but when hydrogen ions bind to amino acids in hemoglobin, they alter its structure slightly, reducing its oxygen-carrying capacity. Thus, a lowered pH drives oxygen off hemoglobin, making more oxygen available to tissue cells. By contrast, elevated pH increases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen and shifts the curve to the left.

2. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide
Carbon dioxide can also bind to hemoglobin, and its effect is similar to that of hydrogen ions, shifting the curve to the right. As PCO2 rises, hemoglobin releases oxygen more readily. Carbon dioxide entering the blood is largely converted to carbonic acid by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in red blood cells: CO2 + H2O ⇌ H2CO3, which dissociates into hydrogen ions and bicarbonate. The carbonic acid thus formed increases hydrogen ion concentration, lowering pH. Consequently, higher CO2 promotes oxygen release from hemoglobin. During exercise, lactic acid produced by anaerobic metabolism within muscles also lowers blood pH. Decreased PCO2 (and elevated pH) shifts the saturation curve to the left.

3. Temperature
Within physiological limits, higher temperature increases the amount of oxygen released from hemoglobin. Heat is a by-product of metabolic reactions in all cells, and the heat released by contracting muscle fibers tends to raise body temperature. Metabolically active cells require more oxygen and produce more acids and heat, and this combination promotes the release of oxygen from oxyhemoglobin. Fever can produce a similar effect. In contrast, during hypothermia, cellular metabolism slows, the need for oxygen diminishes, and more oxygen remains bound to hemoglobin, shifting the curve to the left.

4. BPG (2,3-bisphosphoglycerate)
A substance found in red blood cells called 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen.
