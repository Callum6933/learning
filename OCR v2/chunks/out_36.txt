Peripheral chemoreceptors include the carotid bodies, located near the carotid sinus, and the aortic bodies near the arch of the aorta. As noted in previous chapters, baroreceptors monitor blood pressure, while these chemoreceptors monitor the chemical composition of the blood. Chemoreceptors are sensory receptors that respond to changes in the levels of certain chemicals in the blood. The carotid bodies send their afferent signals through the glossopharyngeal (IX) nerves, and the aortic bodies send signals through the vagus (X) nerves. In addition, olfactory receptors for smell and gustatory receptor cells for taste are likewise chemoreceptors that respond to external stimuli.

Question: Which chemicals stimulate peripheral chemoreceptors?

When carbon dioxide (CO2) is lipid-soluble, it diffuses into cells where, in the presence of carbonic anhydrase, it combines with water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). Carbonic acid quickly dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and bicarbonate (HCO3−). Therefore, an increase in CO2 in the blood leads to an increase in H+ inside cells, while a decrease in CO2 leads to a decrease in H+. Normally, arterial CO2 partial pressure (PCO2) is about 40 mmHg. If even a slight rise occurs—a condition called hypercapnia or hypercarbia—the central chemoreceptors are stimulated and respond vigorously to the resulting rise in H+ concentration. The peripheral chemoreceptors are also stimulated by the high PCO2 and the rise in H+.

In addition, the peripheral chemoreceptors respond to a deficiency of O2. When the PO2 in arterial blood falls from its normal level of about 100 mmHg but remains above about 50 mmHg, the peripheral chemoreceptors are stimulated. A severe deficiency of O2 depresses the activity of the central chemoreceptors and the dorsal respiratory group (DRG), which then do not respond well to inputs and send fewer impulses to the muscles of inhalation. As breathing slows or stops, PO2 falls further, establishing a positive feedback cycle that can have fatal consequences.

The chemoreceptors participate in a negative feedback system that regulates the levels of CO2, O2, and H+ in the blood. When CO2 rises, pH falls (increased H+), or PO2 falls, input from the central and peripheral chemoreceptors causes the DRG to become highly active, increasing the rate and depth of breathing. Hyperventilation, characterized by rapid and deep breathing, enables more O2 to be inhaled and more CO2 to be exhaled, lowering PCO2 and H+ toward normal levels.

If arterial PO2 falls below about 40 mmHg—a state called hypocapnia or hypocarbia—the central and peripheral chemoreceptors are not stimulated, and no stimulatory impulses are sent to the DRG. As a result, DRG neurons set their own moderate pace until CO2 accumulates again and PCO2 rises to about 40 mmHg. DRG neurons are more strongly stimulated when PCO2 rises above normal than when PO2 falls below normal.

As a consequence, people who hyperventilate voluntarily and cause hypocapnia can hold their breath for an unusually long period. Swimmers were once encouraged to hyperventilate before diving to compete. However, this practice is risky because the oxygen level may fall dangerously low and cause fainting before CO2 rises high enough to stimulate inhalation.
