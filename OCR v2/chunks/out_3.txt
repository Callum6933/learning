For healthy individuals, wearing a few layers of material imposes no limiting effects, though the warmer feeling on the face is largely unavoidable. This may not be the case for everyone, especially those with weaker lungs or obstructive conditions such as asthma or COPD, for whom more studies are already underway.

In New Zealand, and in other places, the compulsory wearing of face masks has been a key public health measure used to control the spread of COVID-19. Mandatory masking in settings where social distancing is not possible or during exercise has contributed to suppressing the pandemic in this region.

Bony framework
The nose is supported by a bony and cartilaginous framework that helps keep the vestibule and nasal cavity open. The bony component includes the frontal bone, the nasal bones, and the maxilla.

Cartilaginous framework
The cartilaginous component comprises the lateral nasal cartilages, the septal cartilage, and the alar cartilages, supported by dense fibrous connective tissue and adipose tissue.

Functional anatomy of the nasal cavity
The nasal cavity is divided into a larger inferior respiratory region and a smaller superior olfactory region. The respiratory region is lined with pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium containing numerous goblet cells, a configuration commonly referred to as the respiratory epithelium. The anterior portion just inside the nostrils—the nasal vestibule—is surrounded by cartilage, while the superior part of the nasal cavity is enclosed by bone.

As air enters the nostrils, it first passes through the vestibule, which is lined by skin bearing coarse hairs that filter out large dust particles. Three shelves, formed by the projections of the superior, middle, and inferior nasal conchae, extend from each lateral wall of the nasal cavity and nearly reach the nasal septum. These conchae subdivide each side of the cavity into groovelike air passageways called the superior, middle, and inferior nasal meatuses.

The mucous membrane lines the nasal cavity and its conchae. The arrangement of conchae and meatuses increases the surface area in the internal nose and helps prevent dehydration by trapping water droplets during exhalation. As inhaled air whirls around the conchae and meatuses, it is warmed by blood in the capillaries. Goblet cells secrete mucus to moisten the air and trap dust particles. Drainage from the nasolacrimal ducts also helps moisten the air, and secretions from the paranasal sinuses can contribute as well. The cilia move the mucus and trapped particles toward the pharynx, where they can be swallowed or spit out, thereby removing them from the respiratory tract.

Olfactory region
The olfactory receptor cells, supporting cells, and basal cells lie in the olfactory epithelium, which is located in the respiratory region near the superior nasal conchae and adjacent septum. These cells contain cilia but no goblet cells. As air passes through the nose, it is warmed, filtered, and moistened, and olfaction occurs.
