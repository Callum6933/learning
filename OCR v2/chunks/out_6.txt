The larynx functions in part as a protective gateway during swallowing. As you swallow, the pharynx and larynx rise together. The pharynx elevates to widen the passage for food or drink, while the larynx elevates so the epiglottis can move downward and form a lid over the glottis, effectively closing it. The glottis itself is made up of the vocal folds, or true vocal cords, in the larynx, and the space between them called the rima glottidis. When the larynx closes in this way, liquids and foods are directed toward the esophagus and are kept out of the larynx and the airways. If small particles—dust, smoke, food, or liquids—enter the larynx, a cough reflex is typically triggered to expel the material.

The cricoid cartilage is a ring of hyaline cartilage that forms the inferior wall of the larynx. It attaches to the first ring of cartilage of the trachea by the cricotracheal ligament. The thyroid cartilage is connected to the cricoid by the cricothyroid ligament. The cricoid cartilage serves as a landmark for emergency airways, such as a tracheotomy. The arytenoid cartilages are a pair of triangular pieces of mostly hyaline cartilage located at the posterior, superior border of the cricoid cartilage. They form synovial joints with the cricoid cartilage and have a wide range of mobility. The corniculate cartilages are horn-shaped pieces of elastic cartilage situated at the apex of each arytenoid cartilage. The cuneiform cartilages are wedge-shaped, club-shaped elastic cartilages located anterior to the corniculate cartilages; they support the vocal folds and the lateral aspects of the epiglottis. The larynx is composed of nine cartilaginous elements in total.

Epiglottis: The epiglottis is a flap of elastic cartilage that plays a crucial role during swallowing by covering the laryngeal inlet to prevent food and liquids from entering the airway.

Question: How does the epiglottis prevent aspiration of foods and liquids?

The lining of the larynx above the vocal folds is nonkeratinised stratified squamous epithelium. The lining below the vocal folds is pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium, consisting of ciliated columnar cells, goblet cells, and basal cells. Goblet cells secrete mucus to trap dust and other particles that are not removed in the upper passages. The cilia of the upper respiratory tract move mucus and trapped particles downward toward the pharynx, while the cilia of the lower respiratory tract move them upward toward the pharynx.
