The lobar bronchi form the major divisions within each lung: the right lung has the superior, middle, and inferior lobar bronchi, while the left main bronchus gives rise to the superior and inferior lobar bronchi. Within the lung, these lobar bronchi give rise to the segmental bronchi, which are constant in both origin and distributionâ€”there are ten segmental bronchi in each lung. The portion of lung tissue supplied by each segmental bronchus is called a bronchopulmonary segment. Localized bronchopulmonary disorders, such as tumours or abscesses, can be removed surgically from a segment without causing serious disruption to the surrounding lung tissue. Each bronchopulmonary segment contains many small compartments called lobules; every lobule is wrapped in elastic connective tissue and contains a lymphatic vessel, an arteriole, a venule, and a branch from a terminal bronchiole. Terminal bronchioles subdivide into microscopic branches called respiratory bronchioles, which bear alveoli on their walls. Alveoli participate in gas exchange, so respiratory bronchioles mark the beginning of the respiratory zone of the respiratory system. As respiratory bronchioles extend deeper into the lungs, their epithelial lining changes from simple cuboidal to simple squamous. Respiratory bronchioles then subdivide into several alveolar ducts, each composed of simple squamous epithelium. The respiratory passages from the trachea to the alveolar ducts exhibit about twenty-five orders of branching: first-order branching from the trachea into primary bronchi, second-order branching from main bronchi into lobar bronchi, and so on down to the alveolar ducts.

Microscopic anatomy of a lobule of the lungs

Alveolar sacs consist of two or more alveoli that share a common opening. An alveolus is a cup-shaped outpouching lined by simple squamous epithelium and supported by a thin elastic basement membrane; an alveolar sac consists of two or more alveoli that share a common opening. The walls of the alveoli are formed by two types of alveolar epithelial cells. The more numerous type I alveolar cells are squamous pulmonary epithelial cells that form a nearly continuous lining of the alveolar wall. Type II alveolar cells are rounded or cuboidal in shape, with free surfaces bearing microvilli, and they secrete alveolar fluid that keeps the surface between the cells and the air moist. Included in the alveolar fluid is surfactant, a complex mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins. Surfactant lowers the surface tension of the alveolar fluid, reducing the tendency of the alveoli to collapse and thus helping to maintain their patency. Associated with the alveolar walls are alveolar macrophages (dust cells), phagocytes that remove fine dust particles and other debris from the alveolar spaces. Also present are fibroblasts that produce reticular and elastic fibers. Underlying the layer of Type I alveolar cells lies the basement membrane and a surrounding capillary network that facilitates gas exchange.
