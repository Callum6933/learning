Nasopharynx
The nasopharynx receives air from the nasal cavity through the internal nares, carrying with it any dust-laden mucus that has been picked up along the way. It is lined with pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium, and the cilia move the mucus downward toward the lower part of the pharynx. The nasopharynx also exchanges small amounts of air with the auditory tubes to help equalize air pressure between the middle ear and the atmosphere.

Oropharynx
The intermediate portion of the pharynx, the oropharynx, lies behind the oral cavity and extends from the soft palate down to the level of the hyoid bone. It has only one opening into it, the fauces, which is the passage from the mouth. This part of the pharynx serves both respiratory and digestive functions, acting as a common passageway for air, food, and drink. Because the oropharynx is subjected to abrasion by swallowed food, it is lined with nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium. Two pairs of tonsils, the palatine and lingual tonsils, adorn the oropharynx.

Laryngopharynx
The inferior part of the pharynx, the laryngopharynx, also called the hypopharynx, begins at the level of the hyoid bone. At its lower end it opens posteriorly into the esophagus and anteriorly into the larynx. Like the oropharynx, the laryngopharynx serves as both a respiratory and a digestive pathway and is lined by nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium.

Clinical connection
Tonsillectomy
Tonsillectomy is the surgical removal of the tonsils. This procedure is performed under general anesthesia, typically on an outpatient basis, for individuals with frequent tonsillitis, tonsils that develop an abscess or tumor, or tonsils that obstruct breathing during sleep.

Larynx
The larynx, or voice box, is a short passageway that connects the laryngopharynx with the trachea. It sits in the midline of the neck, anterior to the esophagus and between the fourth and sixth cervical vertebrae (C4–C6). The wall of the larynx comprises nine cartilages: three single cartilages—the thyroid cartilage, the epiglottis, and the cricoid cartilage—and three paired cartilages—the arytenoid, the cuneiform, and the corniculate cartilages. Of the paired cartilages, the arytenoids are the most important because they influence changes in the position and tension of the vocal folds, or true vocal cords, which are essential for speech. The extrinsic muscles connect the laryngeal cartilages to other structures in the throat, while the intrinsic muscles connect the cartilages to one another.

The cavity of the larynx runs from the entrance into the larynx down to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage. The portion of the cavity above the vestibular folds, or false vocal cords, is the laryngeal vestibule. The portion below the vocal folds is the infraglottic, or subglottic, cavity.

The thyroid cartilage, often referred to as the Adam’s apple, consists of two fused plates of hyaline cartilage that form the anterior wall of the larynx and give it its triangular shape. This cartilage is present in both males and females but is usually larger in males due to hormonal influences during puberty. The thyrohyoid membrane connects the thyroid cartilage to the hyoid bone.

The epiglottis is a large, leaf-shaped piece of elastic cartilage covered with epithelium. The stem of the epiglottis is the tapered inferior portion that attaches to the anterior rim of the thyroid cartilage, while the broad superior leaf is unattached and free to move up and down. The epiglottis functions to cover the opening of the larynx during swallowing, helping to prevent food from entering the airway.
