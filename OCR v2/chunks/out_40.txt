The respiratory system begins as the laryngotracheal diverticulum, which gives rise to the trachea and bronchial tree. The trachea and bronchial buds form and branch to produce the major bronchi, eventually developing into secondary and tertiary bronchi as the lungs grow. This rudimentary branching occurs through the early weeks of gestation, with the process continuing as the lung buds expand and the lung lobes form.

From the fourth to the eighth weeks of gestation, development proceeds with the formation of the lung lobes and further bronchial divisions. As the lungs develop, the pleural sacs also form—the visceral pleura and the parietal pleura arise from the mesoderm, and the pleural cavity comes into being between these two layers.

During fetal development, breathing movements cause the aspiration of fluid into the developing lungs. This fluid is a mixture of amniotic fluid, mucus from bronchial glands, and surfactant. At birth, the lungs are about half-filled with fluid. When breathing begins at birth, most of this fluid is rapidly reabsorbed by blood and lymphatic vessels, and a small amount is expelled through the nose and mouth during delivery.

From 26 weeks to birth, many more primitive alveoli develop. These alveoli consist of type I alveolar cells, the main sites of gaseous exchange, and type II cells, which produce surfactant. Blood capillaries establish close contact with the primitive alveoli, enabling gas exchange. Surfactant lowers the surface tension of the alveolar fluid and reduces the tendency of alveoli to collapse on exhalation. Although surfactant production begins by about 20 weeks, it is present in only small quantities. Amounts sufficient to permit survival of a premature infant are not produced until about 26 to 28 weeks’ gestation. Infants born before 26 to 28 weeks face a high risk of respiratory distress syndrome, in which the alveoli collapse during exhalation and must be reinflated during inhalation (see the clinical connection to respiratory distress syndrome in section 23.2). By about 30 weeks, mature alveoli develop. However, it is estimated that only about one-sixth of the full complement of alveoli is present before birth; the remainder develop after birth during the first eight years.

As the lungs develop, they acquire their pleural coverings. The visceral pleura and the parietal pleura develop from mesoderm, and the space between them forms the pleural cavity. The lungs also begin to acquire more defined bronchial structures and alveolar formations, readying themselves for life after birth.

23.9 Ageing and the respiratory system

LEARNING OBJECTIVE 23.9 Describe the effects of ageing on the respiratory system.

With advancing age, the airways and tissues of the respiratory tract, including the alveoli, become less elastic and more rigid; the chest wall becomes more rigid as well. The result is a decrease in lung capacity. In fact, vital capacity—the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled after maximal inhalation—decreases with age.
