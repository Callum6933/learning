Describe how alveolar surface tension, compliance, and airway resistance affect breathing. 15. Demonstrate the various types of modified breathing movements. 23.3 Lung volumes and capacities LEARNING OBJECTIVE 23.3 Differentiate between the different lung volumes and capacities. While at rest, a healthy adult averages 12 breaths a minute, with each inhalation and exhalation moving about 500 mL of air into and out of the lungs. The volume of one breath is called the tidal volume (V7). The minute ventilation (MV) - the total volume of air inhaled and exhaled each minute - is respiratory rate multiplied by tidal volume. MV = 12 breaths/min x 500 mL/breath = 6 litres/min A lower than normal minute ventilation usually is a sign of pulmonary malfunction. The apparatus commonly used to measure the volume of air exchanged during breathing and the respiratory rate is a spirometer (spi-ROM-e-ter; spiro- = breathe; -meter = measuring device) or respirometer (res! -pi-ROM- e-ter). The record is called a spirogram. Inhalation is recorded as an upward deflection, and exhalation is recorded as a downward deflection (figure 23.15).

LUNG CAPACITIES (combinations of lung volumes) QUESTION A 19-year-old male student has a vital capacity of 5 L, tidal volume of 0.5 L, inspiratory capacity of 3.5 L, and functional residual capacity of 2.5 L. What is his expiratory reserve volume? Tidal volume varies considerably from one person to another and in the same person at different times. In a typical adult, about 70% of the tidal volume (350 mL) actually reaches the respiratory zone of the respiratory system - the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli - and participates in external respiration. The other 30% (150 mL) remains in the conducting airways of the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and terminal bronchioles. Collectively, the conducting airways with air that does not undergo respiratory exchange are known as the anatomic (respiratory) dead space. (An easy rule of thumb for determining the volume of your anatomic dead space is that it is about the same in milliliters as your ideal weight in pounds.) Not all of the minute ventilation can be used 1116 Principles of anatomy and physiology Â© John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd. Not for resale or distribution.

The alveolar ventilation rate is the volume of air per minute that actually reaches the respiratory zone. In the example just given, alveolar ventilation rate would be 350 mL/breath x 12 breaths/min = 4200 mL/min. Several other lung volumes are defined relative to forceful breathing. In general, these volumes are larger in males, taller individuals, and younger adults, and smaller in females, shorter individuals, and the elderly. Various disorders also may be diagnosed by comparison of actual and predicted normal values for a patient's gender, height, and age. The values given here are averages for young adults. By taking a very deep breath, you can inhale a good deal more than 500 mL. This additional inhaled air, called the inspiratory reserve volume, is abo
