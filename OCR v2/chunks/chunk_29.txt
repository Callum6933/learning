h O, binds to haemoglobin is the Po,; the higher the Po, the more O, combines with Hb. When reduced haemoglobin (Hb) is completely converted to oxyhaemoglobin (Hb-O,), the haemoglobin is said to be fully saturated; when haemoglobin consists of a mixture and Hb-O,, it is partially saturated. The per cent saturation of haemoglobin expresses the average saturation of haemoglobin with oxygen. For instance, if each haemoglobin molecule has bound two O, molecules, then the haemoglobin is 50% saturated because each Hb can bind a maximum of four O). 1122 Principles of anatomy and physiology © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

The relationship between the per cent saturation of haemoglobin and Po, is illustrated in the oxygen- haemoglobin dissociation curve in figure 23.18. Note that when the Po, is high, haemoglobin binds with large amounts of O, and is almost 100% saturated. When Po, is low, haemoglobin is only partially saturated. In other words, the greater the Po,, the more O) will bind to haemoglobin, until all the available haemoglobin molecules are saturated. Therefore, in pulmonary capillaries, where Po, is high, a lot of O, binds to haemoglobin. In tissue capillaries, where the Po, is lower, haemoglobin does not hold as much O, and the dissolved O) is unloaded via diffusion into tissue cells (see figure 23.17b). Note that haemoglobin is still 75% saturated with O, at , of 40 mmHg, the average Po, of tissue cells in a person at rest. This is the basis for the earlier statement that only 25% of the available O, unloads from haemoglobin and is used by tissue cells under resting conditions. © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

In your pulmonary veins if you were jogging? When the Po, is between 60 and 100 mmHg, haemoglobin is 90% or more saturated with O7 (figure 23.18). Thus, blood picks up a nearly full load of O, from the lungs even when the Po, of alveolar air is as low as 60 mmHg. The Hb-Po, curve explains why people can still perform well at high altitudes or when they have certain cardiac and pulmonary diseases, even though Po, may drop as low as 60 mmHg. Note also in the curve that at a considerably lower Po, of 40 mmHg, haemoglobin is still 75% saturated with O,. However, oxygen saturation drops to 35% at 20 mmHg. Between 40 and 20 mmHg, large amounts of O, are released from haemoglobin in response to only small decreases ,. In active tissues such as contracting muscles, Po, may drop well below
