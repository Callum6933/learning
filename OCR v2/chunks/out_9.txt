Airflow can be obstructed in several ways: the rings of cartilage that support the trachea may be crushed; the mucous membrane can become inflamed and swell enough to close the passage; excess mucus produced by inflamed membranes may clog the lower airways; a large object can be aspirated (breathed in); or a cancerous tumor may protrude into the airway. To restore airflow past a tracheal obstruction, two methods are used. If the obstruction is above the level of the larynx, a tracheotomy, also called a tracheostomy, may be performed. This procedure involves a skin incision followed by a short longitudinal incision into the trachea below the cricoid cartilage, after which a tracheal tube is inserted to create an emergency airway passage. The second method is intubation, in which a tube is inserted through the mouth or nose and threaded downward past the larynx and trachea. The firm wall of the tube helps push aside any flexible obstruction, and the lumen provides a passage for air; any mucus clogging the trachea can be suctioned out through the tube.

Bronchi
At the superior border of the fifth thoracic vertebra, the trachea divides into the right main bronchus, which goes into the right lung, and the left main bronchus, which goes into the left lung. The right main bronchus is more vertical, shorter, and wider than the left; consequently, an aspirated object is more likely to enter and lodge in the right main bronchus than in the left. Like the trachea, the main bronchi contain incomplete rings of cartilage and are lined by pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium.

Branching of airways from the trachea forms the bronchial tree, a system of macroscopic airways that begins at the trachea and extends through the terminal bronchioles.

On entering the lungs, the main bronchi divide to form smaller bronchiâ€”the lobar (secondary) bronchi, one for each lobe of the lung. The right lung has three lobes, while the left lung has two. The lobar bronchi continue to branch, forming even smaller bronchi called segmental (tertiary) bronchi, each supplying a specific bronchopulmonary segment within the lobes. The segmental bronchi then divide into bronchioles. Bronchioles branch repeatedly, and the smallest bronchioles give rise to terminal bronchioles.

The terminal bronchioles contain club cells, also known as Clara cells, which are columnar, nonciliated cells interspersed among the epithelial cells. Club cells may protect against the harmful effects of inhaled toxins and carcinogens, produce surfactant, and function as stem cells (reserve cells) that give rise to various cells of the epithelium. The terminal bronchioles mark the end of the conducting airways and lead into the gas-exchange regions of the lung. 

Question
How many lobes and secondary bronchi are present in each lung? 
Where the trachea divides into the right and left main bronchi, an internal ridge called the carina forms, produced by a posterior and somewhat inferior projection of the last tracheal cartilage. The mucous membrane of the carina is one of the most sensitive areas of the larynx and trachea, and is a major trigger for coughing. Widening or distortion of the carina is a serious sign, usually indicating involvement of lymph nodes around the region where the trachea divides.

From the main bronchi onward, the airways progressively form the bronchial tree. The main bronchi divide to form lobar (secondary) bronchi; the right lung has three lobes, and the left has two. The lobar bronchi divide into segmental (tertiary) bronchi, which supply the bronchopulmonary segments within each lobe. The segmental bronchi divide into bronchioles, which then branch into terminal bronchioles. These terminal bronchioles contain club cells, which are capable of protecting against inhaled toxins and carcinogens, producing surfactant, and acting as reserve stem cells to replace damaged cells.
