Asthma-like symptoms, or damage to the small airways, can affect lung health and the body’s ability to fight infection. Fortunately, the Australian Institute, with expert guidance, has provided both general and exercise-specific advice for athletes, coaches, and the wider public. These guidelines outline activities that modify ventilation requirements and describe training environments that help filter and clean the air, such as indoor training when possible. Understanding the importance of maintaining a healthy and functioning respiratory system should encourage athletes to minimise the risks that poor air quality poses to this critical body system during exercise. With an expected increase in poor air quality in the future—not only from bushfires—these guidelines are a valuable resource for anyone participating in exercise when air quality deteriorates. The guidance factors in measurable air quality and types of recommendations for adapting training and competition to air-quality conditions.

Lungs
The lungs are paired, cone-shaped organs in the thoracic cavity. They are separated from each other by the heart and other structures of the mediastinum, which divides the thoracic cavity into two distinct compartments. As a result, if trauma causes one lung to collapse, the other may remain expanded. Each lung is enclosed and protected by a double-layered serous membrane called the pleural membrane. The superficial layer is the parietal pleura, which lines the wall of the thoracic cavity, while the deep layer is the visceral pleura, which covers the lungs themselves. Between the visceral and parietal pleurae is a small space—the pleural cavity—containing a small amount of lubricating fluid secreted by the membranes. This pleural fluid reduces friction between the membranes, allowing them to slide easily over one another during breathing. Pleural fluid also helps hold the two membranes together, functioning much like a thin film of water that causes two glass slides to stick together, a phenomenon known as surface tension. Separate pleural cavities surround the left and right lungs. Inflammation of the pleural membrane, pleurisy or pleuritis, may initially be painful due to friction between the parietal and visceral layers. If the inflammation persists, excess fluid can accumulate in the pleural space, a condition called pleural effusion.

Relationship of the pleural membranes to the lungs
The parietal pleura lines the thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura covers the lungs. The lungs extend from the diaphragm to just above the clavicles and lie against the ribs both anteriorly and posteriorly. The broad inferior portion of each lung, the base, is concave and rests on the convex diaphragm. The narrow superior portion is the apex. The surface of the lung that lies against the ribs is the costal surface, which follows the curvature of the ribs. The mediastinal (medial) surface of each lung contains a region called the hilum, through which bronchi, pulmonary blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves enter and exit.
