About 1 cm (0.4 in.) of a diaphragm descent during quiet breathing produces a pressure difference of 1–3 mmHg and lets in roughly 500 mL of air. In strenuous breathing, the diaphragm can descend as much as 10 cm (4 in.), generating a pressure difference of about 100 mmHg and drawing in 2–3 litres of air. The contraction of the diaphragm is responsible for roughly 75% of the air that enters the lungs during quiet breathing. Advanced pregnancy, excessive obesity, or constrictive abdominal clothing can prevent the diaphragm from descending fully.

Boyle's law
The volume of a gas varies inversely with its pressure.

Question
If the volume is decreased from 1 litre to 1/2 litre, how would the pressure change?

Muscles of inhalation and exhalation
The pectoralis minor muscle, which is not shown here, can assist during breathing.

During normal, quiet inhalation, the diaphragm and external intercostals contract, the lungs expand, and air moves into the lungs. During normal, quiet exhalation, the diaphragm and external intercostals relax and the lungs recoil, forcing air out of the lungs.

Inhalation involves the diaphragm and the external intercostals contracting, which expands the chest cavity and lowers alveolar pressure, allowing air to flow into the lungs. The external intercostals lift the ribs, increasing the anteroposterior and lateral dimensions of the chest cavity. The external intercostals contribute about 25% of the air that enters the lungs during normal quiet breathing.

During quiet inhalations, the intrapleural pressure—the pressure between the pleural layers in the pleural cavity—is always subatmospheric (lower than atmospheric pressure). Just before inhalation, it is about 4 mmHg below atmospheric pressure. As the diaphragm and external intercostals contract and the thoracic cavity enlarges, the volume of the pleural cavity increases and intrapleural pressure falls further.

The pleural spaces are kept open because the subatmospheric intrapleural pressure and the surface tension of the moist pleural surfaces hold the parietal and visceral pleurae together. As the thoracic cavity expands, the parietal pleura is pulled outward in all directions, and the visceral pleura and the lungs follow.

During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts, the chest expands, the lungs are pulled outward, and alveolar pressure decreases. During exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes, the lungs recoil inward, and alveolar pressure increases, pushing air out of the lungs.

Right now, what is the main muscle powering your breathing?

Other inspiratory muscles, such as the sternocleidomastoid and the scalene muscles, assist during deeper or more forceful breaths. The next most important muscles of inhalation are the external intercostals; when these muscles contract, they elevate the ribs and enlarge the chest cavity.
