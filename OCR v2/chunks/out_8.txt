Vocal characteristics arise in part from hormones. Because of the influence of androgens, the male sex hormones, the vocal folds are usually thicker and longer in males than in females, so they vibrate more slowly. This explains why a man’s voice generally has a lower pitch range than a woman’s. Sound originates from the vibration of the vocal folds, but additional structures are required to convert that sound into recognisable speech. The pharynx, mouth, nasal cavity, and paranasal sinuses act as resonating chambers, giving the voice its human and individual quality. Vowel sounds are produced by constricting and relaxing the muscles in the walls of the pharynx. Muscles of the face, tongue, and lips assist in enunciating words.

Whispering is achieved by closing all but the posterior portion of the rima glottidis. Because the vocal folds do not vibrate during whispering, there is no pitch to this form of speech. Nevertheless, intelligible speech can be produced while whispering by altering the shape of the oral cavity as we enunciate. As the size of the oral cavity changes, its resonance qualities change as well, imparting a vowel-like pitch to the air as it travels toward the lips.

Trachea
The trachea, also called the windpipe, is a sturdy tube through which air moves. It is about 12 cm (5 in.) long and 2.5 cm (1 in.) in diameter. The trachea lies anterior to the esophagus and extends from the larynx to the upper border of the fifth thoracic vertebra, where it divides into the right and left primary bronchi.

QUESTION
What is the benefit of not having complete rings of tracheal cartilage between the trachea and the esophagus?

The layers of the tracheal wall, from deep to superficial, are the mucosa, submucosa, hyaline cartilage, and adventitia. The mucosa consists of an epithelial layer of pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with a lamina propria that contains elastic and reticular fibers, providing protection against dust in a manner similar to the membrane lining the nasal cavity and larynx. The submucosa is made of areolar connective tissue and contains seromucous glands and their ducts.

The trachea contains 16–20 incomplete, horizontal rings of hyaline cartilage that resemble the letter C, stacked one above another and connected by dense connective tissue. These rings can be felt beneath the skin just inferior to the larynx. The open part of each C-shaped ring faces posteriorly toward the esophagus and is bridged by a fibromuscular membrane. Within this membrane lie transverse smooth muscle fibers, the trachealis muscle, and elastic connective tissue, which allow the trachea’s diameter to change subtly during inhalation and exhalation, aiding efficient airflow. The solid C-shaped cartilage rings provide semirigid support to keep the trachea patent, preventing inward collapse of the tracheal wall and obstruction of the air passageway. The adventitia consists of areolar connective tissue that attaches the trachea to surrounding tissues.
