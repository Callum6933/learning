Blood drains into the bronchial veins, branches of the azygos system, and returns to the heart via the superior vena cava.

Patency of the respiratory system
Throughout the discussion of the respiratory organs, several examples were given of structures or secretions that help to keep air passages open and free from obstruction. These include the bony and cartilaginous frameworks of the nose, the skeletal muscles of the pharynx, the cartilages of the larynx, the C-shaped rings of cartilage in the trachea and bronchi, the smooth muscle in the bronchioles, and the surfactant produced in the alveoli. There are, however, factors that can compromise patency. Crushing injuries to bone and cartilage, a deviated nasal septum, nasal polyps, inflammation of the mucous membranes, spasms of smooth muscle, and surfactant deficiency can all threaten airway openness.

A summary of the epithelial linings and special features of the organs of the respiratory system is given here.

Nose
- Vestibule: Epithelium is nonkeratinised stratified squamous; there are no cilia and no goblet cells; special features include numerous hairs.
- Respiratory region: Epithelium is pseudostratified ciliated columnar; cilia and goblet cells are present; special features include conchae and nasal meatuses.
- Olfactory region: Epithelium is olfactory; goblet cells are not present; this region functions in olfaction via olfactory receptors.

Pharynx
- Nasopharynx: Epithelium is pseudostratified ciliated columnar; goblet cells are present; special features include passageways for air and openings for the internal nares, auditory tubes, and pharyngeal tonsil.
- Oropharynx: Epithelium is nonkeratinised stratified squamous; goblet cells are not present; special features include a passageway for both air and food and drink, with the opening from the mouth (fauces).
- Laryngopharynx: Epithelium is nonkeratinised stratified squamous; goblet cells are not present; special features include a passageway for both air and food.

Larynx
- Epithelium: Above the vocal folds it is nonkeratinised stratified squamous; below the vocal folds it is pseudostratified ciliated columnar.
- Special features: The larynx contains folds that include the vocal folds, important for voice production.

Trachea
- Epithelium: Pseudostratified ciliated columnar; goblet cells are present.
- Special features: It serves as a passageway for air and contains C-shaped rings of cartilage to keep the trachea open.

Bronchi
- Main bronchi: Epithelium is pseudostratified ciliated columnar; goblet cells are present; special features include the C-shaped rings of cartilage that help maintain patency.
- Lobar bronchi: Epithelium is pseudostratified ciliated columnar; goblet cells are present; special features include plates of cartilage to maintain patency.
- Segmental bronchi: Epithelium is pseudostratified ciliated columnar; goblet cells are present; special features include plates of cartilage to maintain patency.
- Bronchioles: Epithelium transitions to a smaller, more simple form; goblet cells are present initially, but there is relatively more smooth muscle in the larger bronchioles than in the smaller ones.
- Terminal bronchioles: Epithelium is nonciliated simple columnar; goblet cells are absent; special features include a greater amount of smooth muscle than in the smaller bronchioles.

Lungs
- Respiratory structures: Epithelium ranges from simple cuboidal to simple squamous; goblet cells are not present; the region serves as a passageway for air and supports gas exchange.
- Alveolar ducts: Epithelium is simple squamous; goblet cells are not present; special features include their role in gas exchange and their involvement in surfactant production.
- Alveoli: Epithelium is simple squamous; goblet cells are not present; they function in gas exchange and are involved in surfactant production to help maintain patency.
