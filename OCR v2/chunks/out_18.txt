ALVEOLAR PRESSURE

At rest, when the diaphragm is relaxed, the alveolar pressure equals atmospheric pressure, and there is no air flow. During quiet inhalation, the lungs expand and the alveolar pressure drops slightly, from 760 mmHg to 758 mmHg. This small drop creates a pressure difference between the atmosphere and the alveoli, and air flows into the lungs as long as that gradient exists. During deep, forceful inhalations, accessory muscles of inspiration participate in increasing the size of the thoracic cavity. The sternocleidomastoid muscles elevate the sternum, the scalene muscles lift the first two ribs, and the pectoralis minor muscles elevate the third through fifth ribs. Because both normal quiet inhalation and inhalation during exercise or forced ventilation involve muscular contraction, the process of inhalation is active.

INTRAPLEURAL PRESSURE

The intrapleural pressure is the pressure within the pleural cavity. As the chest expands during inspiration, the intrapleural pressure becomes more negative, creating a gradient that helps the lungs expand. During quiet exhalation, the diaphragm and external intercostals relax, the chest wall and lungs recoil, the chest cavity decreases in size, and the alveolar pressure rises above atmospheric pressure. Air then flows out of the lungs in response to this pressure gradient, and the lung volume decreases. During forced exhalations, the internal intercostals and abdominal muscles contract, further reducing the size of the chest cavity and producing a greater rise in alveolar pressure.

QUESTION How does the intrapleural pressure change during a normal, quiet breath?

As the volume of the lungs increases, the pressure inside the lungs—alveolar (intrapulmonic) pressure—drops from 760 mmHg to 758 mmHg. A pressure difference is thus established between the atmosphere and the alveoli. Because air always moves from higher to lower pressure, inhalation occurs. Air continues to flow into the lungs as long as a pressure difference exists. During deep, forceful inhalations, accessory muscles of inspiration also participate in increasing the size of the thoracic cavity. These muscles are so named because they make little, if any, contribution during normal quiet inhalation, but during exercise or forced ventilation they may contract vigorously. The accessory muscles of inhalation include the sternocleidomastoid muscles, which elevate the sternum; the scalene muscles, which elevate the first two ribs; and the pectoralis minor muscles, which elevate the third through fifth ribs. Because both normal quiet inhalation and inhalation during exercise or forced ventilation involve muscular contraction, the process of inhalation is said to be active.

EXHALATION

Breathing out, or exhalation, is driven by a pressure gradient in the opposite direction: the pressure in the lungs is greater than atmospheric pressure. Normal exhalation during quiet breathing is a passive process because no muscular contractions are involved. Exhalation results from the elastic recoil of the chest wall and lungs, which tend to spring back after being stretched. Two inwardly directed forces contribute to elastic recoil: the rebound of elastic fibers stretched during inhalation, and the inward pull of surface tension from the thin film of alveolar fluid. Exhalation starts when the inspiratory muscles relax. As the diaphragm relaxes, its dome moves superiorly due to its elasticity. As the external intercostals relax, the ribs are depressed. These movements decrease the vertical, lateral, and anteroposterior dimensions of the thoracic cavity, reducing lung volume. Consequently, the alveolar pressure rises to about 762 mmHg, and air flows from the alveoli to the atmosphere.

Exhalation becomes an active process only during forceful breathing, such as when playing a wind instrument or during intense exercise. At those times, the abdominal and internal intercostal muscles contract, increasing pressure in the abdominal region and thorax. Contraction of the abdominal muscles further elevates intra-abdominal pressure and aids in expelling air.
