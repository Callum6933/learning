A person undergoing hyperbaric oxygenation drowning, asphyxia, vascular insufficiencies, and burns. External and internal respiration External respiration or pulmonary gas exchange is the diffusion of O, from air in the alveoli of the lungs to blood in pulmonary capillaries and the diffusion of CO, in the opposite direction (figure 23.16a). External respiration in the lungs converts deoxygenated blood (depleted of some O) coming from the right side of the heart into oxygenated blood (saturated with O,) that returns to the left side of the heart (see figure 21.29). As blood flows through the pulmonary capillaries, it picks up O, from alveolar air and unloads CO, into alveolar air. Although this process is commonly called an 'exchange' of gases, each gas diffuses independently from the area where its partial pressure is higher to the area where its partial pressure is lower. © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

As figure 23.16a shows, O, diffuses from alveolar air, where its partial pressure is 105 mmHg, into the blood in pulmonary capillaries, where Po, is only 40 mmHg in a resting person. If you have been exercising, the Po, will be even lower because contracting muscle fibres are using more Oj. Diffusion continues until the Po, of pulmonary capillary blood increases to match the Po, of alveolar air, 105 mmHg. Because blood leaving pulmonary capillaries near alveolar air spaces mixes with a small volume of blood that has flowed through conducting portions of the respiratory system, where gas exchange does not occur, the Po, of blood in the pulmonary veins is slightly less than the Po, in pulmonary capillaries, about 100 mmHg. While O, is diffusing from alveolar air into deoxygenated blood, CO, is diffusing in the opposite direction. The Peo, of deoxygenated blood is 45 mmHg in a resting person, and the Pcg, of alveolar air is 40 mmHg. Because of this difference ,: carbon dioxide diffuses from deoxygenated blood into the alveoli until the Peo, of the blood decreases to 40 mmHg. Exhalation keeps alveolar Peo, at 40 mmHg. Oxygenated blood returning to the left side of the heart in the pulmonary veins thus has , of 40 mmHg. 7 Changes in partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide (in mmHg) during external and internal respiration.

The number of capillaries near alveoli in the lungs is very large, and blood flows slowly enough through these capillaries that it picks up a maximal amount of O,. During vigorous exercise, when cardiac output is increased, blood flows more rapidly through both the systemic and pulmonary circulations. As a result, blood's transit time in the pulmonary capillaries is shorter. Still, the Po, of blood in the pulmonary veins normally reaches 100 mmHg. In diseases that decrease the rate of gas diffusion, however, the blood may not come into full equilibrium with alveolar air, especially during exercise. Wh
