23.1 Respiratory system anatomy LEARNING OBJECTIVE 23.1 Describe the anatomical structure and function of the respiratory system components. The respiratory system (RES-pi-ra-t6r-é) consists of the nose, pharynx (throat), larynx (voice box), trachea (windpipe), bronchi, and lungs (figure 23.1). Its parts can be classified according to either structure or function. Structurally, the respiratory system consists of two parts. (1) The upper respiratory system includes the nose, nasal cavity, pharynx, and associated structures; (2) the lower respiratory system includes the larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs. Functionally, the respiratory system also consists of two parts. (1) The conducting zone consists of a series of interconnecting cavities and tubes both outside and within the lungs. These include the nose, nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and terminal bronchioles; their function is to filter, warm, and moisten air and conduct it into the lungs. (2) The respiratory zone consists of tubes and tissues within the lungs where gas exchange occurs. These include the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli and are the main sites of gas exchange between air and blood. Structures of the respiratory system. | FIGURE 23.1 | T he upper respiratory system includes the nose, nasal cavity, pharynx, and associated structures; the lower respiratory system includes the larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs. FUNCTIONS OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 1. Provides for gas exchange: intake of O, for delivery to body cells and removal of CO, produced by body cells. 2. Helps regulate blood pH. 3. Contains receptors for sense of smell, filters inspired air, produces vocal sounds (phonation), and excretes small amounts of water and heat.

The branch of medicine that deals with the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the ears, nose, and throat (ENT) is called otorhinolaryngology (6/-t6-ri'-n6-lar-in-GOL-o0-jé; ofo- = ear; -rhino- = nose; -laryngo- = voice box; -logy = study of). A pulmonologist (pul/-mo-NOL-6-jist) is a specialist in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the lungs. Nose The nose is a specialised organ at the entrance of the respiratory system that consists of a visible external portion and an internal portion inside the skull called the nasal cavity. The external nose is the portion of the nose visible on the face and consists of a supporting framework of bone and hyaline cartilage covered with muscle and skin and lined by a mucous membrane. The frontal bone, nasal bones, and maxillae form the bony framework of the external nose (figure 23.2a). The cartilaginous framework of the external nose consists of several pieces of hyaline cartilage connected to each other and certain skull bones by fibrous © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

The components of the cartilaginous framework are the septal nasal cartilage, which forms the anterior portion of the nasal septum; the Jateral nasal cartilages inferior to the nasal bones; and the alar cartilages (A-lar), which form a portion of the walls of the nostrils. Because it consists of pliable hyaline cartilage, the cartilaginous framework of the external nose is somewhat flexible. On the undersurface of the external nose are two openings called the external nares (NA-rez; singular is naris) or nostrils. The interior structures of the external nose have three functions: (1) warming, moistening, and filtering incoming air; (2) detecting olfactory stimuli; and (3) modifying speech vibrations as they pass through the large, hollow resonating chambers. Resonance refers to prolonging, amplifying, or modifying a sound by vibration. The nasal cavity is a large space in the anterior aspect of the skull that lies inferior to the nasal bone and superior to the oral cavity; it is lined with muscle and mucous membrane. A vertical partition, the nasal septum, divides the nasal cavity into right and left sides. The anterior portion of the nasal septum consists primarily of hyaline cartilage; the remainder is formed by the vomer, perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, maxillae, and palatine bones (see figure 7.11). Anteriorly, the nasal cavity merges with the external nose, and posteriorly it communicates with the pharynx through two openings called the internal nares or choanae (k6-A-né) (see figure 23.2b). Ducts from the paranasal sinuses (which drain mucous) and the nasolacrimal ducts (which drain tears) also open into the nasal cavity. Recall from chapter 7 that the paranasal sinuses are cavities in certain cranial and facial bones lined with mucous membrane that are continuous with the lining of the nasal cavity. Skull bone, containing the paranasal sinuses are the frontal, sphenoid, ethmoid, and maxillae. Besides producing mucous, the paranasal sinuses serve as resonating chambers for sound as we speak or sing. The lateral walls of the internal nose are formed by the ethmoid, maxillae, lacrimal, palatine, and inferior nasal conchae bones (see figure 7.9); the ethmoid bone also forms the roof. The palatine bones and palatine processes of the maxillae, which together constitute the hard palate, form the floor of the internal nose. CLINICAL CONNECTION Limiting COVID-19 viral transmission with face masks As a respiratory pump, the breath-by-breath ventilation of alveoli ranges from as little as 5 L/minute to greater than 200 L/minute during increased metabolic demand such as exercise. Transmission of the internal environment of the body is expelled during the expiratory phase of the breathing cycle. Infectious transmission, such as with the common cold and flu viruses, usually fluctuates seasonally, with increased transmission throughout the population in the winter months. No doubt the flu virus has been histori- cally deadly, impacting the most vulnerable. Yet, when the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, it quickly became evident that its infectious potential, primarily via expired air from the lungs, required a modified approach to reducing or eliminating aerosol and droplet contact. Most interestingly, mapping of droplet spread showed that a 1.5 metre dis- tance between two people reduced the chance of infec- tion spread, however, in activities such as exercise these droplets could travel much further, powered by the more rapidly expired air and forceful breathing.° Face-mask technology, to control and capture respira- tory ventilation, already existed in medical, emergency, and occupationally dangerous environments such as mining. The primary objective had been to protect the wearer from inhaling infectious or dangerous airborne particles. Yet, the emerging public health challenge posed by COVID-19 required a determination of the effectiveness of simple cloth or polyester masks both in terms of protecting the wearer from infected others, and in reducing the expired droplets of the wearer in the event they were infected with no obvious symptoms. Cloth masks, with two to three layers, are deemed to be most effective, especially when changed on a regular basis to prevent the material being saturated. Given that exercise does require increased air movement in and out of the lungs, it has been important to determine what effect wearing a face mask has on performing exercise per se. Acknowledging the short time frame to conduct and publish such data, early indications report there are no limiting effects of a few material layers for healthy individuals,* although the unpleasant sensation of feeling warmer on the face is largely unavoidable. The same may not be true for others with weaker lungs or obstructive conditions such as asthma and COPD, where more studies are already underway. In countries such and New Zealand, the compulsory wearing of face masks has greatly contributed to public health measures used to successfully control the infectious spread of the COVID-19 virus. The mandatory wearing in certain settings where social distancing is not possible or when exercise is occurring has contributed to suppression of the pandemic in this part of the world. 1092 Principles of anatomy and physiology © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

The bony and cartilaginous framework of the nose help to keep the vestibule and nasal cavity patent, that is, open or unobstructed. The nasal cavity is divided into a larger, inferior respiratory region and a smaller, superior olfactory region. The respiratory region is lined with pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with numerous goblet cells, which is frequently called the respiratory epithelium (see table 4.1). The anterior portion of the nasal cavity just inside the nostrils, called the nasal vestibule, is surrounded by cartilage; the superior part of the nasal cavity is surrounded by bone. When air enters the nostrils, it passes first through the vestibule, which is lined by skin containing coarse hairs that filter out large dust particles. Three shelves formed by projections of the superior, middle, and inferior nasal conchae extend out of each lateral wall of the nasal cavity. The conchae, almost reaching the nasal septum, subdivide each side of the nasal cavity into a series of groovelike air passageways - the superior, middle, and inferior nasal meatuses (mé-A-tus-éz = openings or passages; singular is meatus). Mucous membrane lines the nasal cavity and its shelves. The arrangement of conchae and meatuses increases surface area in the internal nose and prevents dehydration by trapping water droplets during exhalation. As inhaled air whirls around the conchae and meatuses, it is warmed by blood in the capillaries. Mucous secreted by the goblet cells moistens the air and traps dust particles. Drainage from the nasolacrimal ducts also helps moisten the air, and is sometimes assisted by secretions from the paranasal sinuses. The cilia move the mucous and trapped dust particles towards the pharynx, at which point they can be swallowed or spit out, thus removing the particles from the respiratory tract. The olfactory receptor cells, supporting cells, and basal cells lie in the respiratory region, which is near the superior nasal conchae and adjacent septum. These cells make up the olfactory epithelium. It contains cilia but no goblet cells. Respiratory structure: the head and neck. As air passes through the nose, it is warmed, filtered, and moistened; and olfaction occurs.

Pharynx The pharynx (FAR-inks), or throat, is a funnel-shaped tube about 13 cm (5 in.) long that starts at the internal nares and extends to the level of the cricoid cartilage, the most inferior cartilage of the larynx (voice box) (see figure 23.2b). The pharynx lies just posterior to the nasal and oral cavities, superior to the larynx, and just anterior to the cervical vertebrae. Its wall is composed of skeletal muscles and is lined with a mucous membrane. Relaxed skeletal muscles help keep the pharynx patent. Contraction of the skeletal muscles assists in deglutition (swallowing). The pharynx functions as a passageway for air and food, provides a resonating chamber for speech sounds, and houses the tonsils, which participate in immunological reactions against foreign invaders. © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd. Not for resale or distribution. Any unauthorised distribution or use will result in legal action. The pharynx can be divided into three anatomical regions: (1) nasopharynx, (2) oropharynx, and (3) laryngopharynx. (See the lower orientation diagram in figure 23.2b.) The muscles of the entire pharynx are arranged in two layers, an outer circular layer and an inner longitudinal layer. The superior portion of the pharynx, called the nasopharynx, lies posterior to the nasal cavity and extends to the soft palate. The soft palate, which forms the posterior portion of the roof of the mouth, is an arch-shaped muscular partition between the nasopharynx and oropharynx that is lined by mucous membrane. There are five openings in its wall: two internal nares, two openings that lead into the auditory (pharyngotympanic) tubes (commonly known as the eustachian tubes), and the opening into the oropharynx. The posterior wall also contains the pharyngeal tonsil (fa-RIN-je-al), or adenoid. Through the internal nares, the nasopharynx receives air from the nasal cavity along with packages of dust-laden mucous. The nasopharynx is lined with pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium, and the cilia move the mucous down towards the most inferior part of the pharynx. The nasopharynx also exchanges small amounts of air with the auditory tubes to equalise air pressure between the middle ear and the atmosphere. The intermediate portion of the pharynx, the oropharynx, lies posterior to the oral cavity and extends from the soft palate inferiorly to the level of the hyoid bone. It has only one opening into it, the fauces (FAW-séz = throat), the opening from the mouth. This portion of the pharynx has both respiratory and digestive functions, serving as a common passageway for air, food, and drink. Because the oropharynx is subject to abrasion by food particles, it is lined with nonkeratinised stratified squamous epithelium. Two pairs of tonsils, the palatine and lingual tonsils, are found in the oropharynx. The inferior portion of the pharynx, the laryngopharynx (la-RING-g6-far-ingks), or hypopharynx, begins at the level of the hyoid bone. At its inferior end it opens into the oesophagus (food tube) posteriorly and the larynx (voice box) anteriorly. Like the oropharynx, the laryngopharynx is both a respiratory and a digestive pathway and is lined by nonkeratinised stratified squamous epithelium. CLINICAL CONNECTION Tonsillectomy patient basis. Tonsillectomies are performed in individuals Tonsillectomy (ton-si-LEK-t6-mé; -ektome = excision or to who have frequent tonsillitis (ton'-si-LI-tis); that is, inflam- cut out) is surgical removal of the tonsils. The procedure mation of the tonsils; tonsils that develop an abscess or is usually performed under general anaesthesia on an out- tumour; or tonsils that obstruct breathing during sleep. Larynx The larynx (LAR-ingks), or voice box, is a short passageway that connects the laryngopharynx with the trachea. It lies in the midline of the neck anterior to the oesophagus and the fourth through sixth cervical vertebrae (C4-C6). The wall of the larynx is composed of nine pieces of cartilage (figure 23.4). Three occur singly (thyroid cartilage, epiglottis, and cricoid cartilage), and three occur in pairs (arytenoid, cuneiform, and corniculate cartilages). Of the paired cartilages, the arytenoid cartilages are the most important because they influence changes in position and tension of the vocal folds (true vocal cords for speech). The extrinsic muscles of the larynx connect the cartilages to other structures in the throat; the intrinsic muscles connect the cartilages to one another. The cavity of the larynx is the space that extends from the entrance into the larynx down to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage (described shortly). The portion of the cavity of the larynx above the vestibular folds (false vocal cords) is called the laryngeal vestibule. The portion of the cavity of the larynx below the vocal folds is called the infraglottic cavity (infra- = below) (figure 23.4d). The thyroid cartilage (Adam's apple) consists of two fused plates of hyaline cartilage that form the anterior wall of the larynx and give it a triangular shape. It is present in both males and females but is usually larger in males due to the influence of male sex hormones on its growth during puberty. The ligament that connects the thyroid cartilage to the hyoid bone is called the thyrohyoid membrane. The epiglottis (epi- = over; -glottis = tongue) is a large, leaf-shaped piece of elastic cartilage that is covered with epithelium (see also figure 23.2b). The 'stem' of the epiglottis is the tapered inferior portion that is attached to the anterior rim of the thyroid cartilage. The broad superior 'leaf' portion of the epiglottis is unattached and is free to move up and down like a trap door. During swallowing, the pharynx and larynx rise. Elevation of the pharynx widens it to receive food or drink; elevation of the larynx causes the epiglottis to move down and form a lid over the glottis, closing it off. The glottis consists of a pair of folds of mucous membrane, the vocal folds (true vocal cords) in the larynx, and the space between them called the rima 1096 Principles of anatomy and physiology © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd. Not for resale or distribution. Any unauthorised distribution or use will result in legal action. glottidis (RI-ma GLOT-ti-dis). The closing of the larynx in this way during swallowing routes liquids and foods into the oesophagus and keeps them out of the larynx and airways. When small particles of dust, smoke, food, or liquids pass into the larynx, a cough reflex occurs, usually expelling the material. The cricoid cartilage (KRI-koyd = ringlike) is a ring of hyaline cartilage that forms the inferior wall of the larynx. It is attached to the first ring of cartilage of the trachea by the cricotracheal ligament (kri'- k6-TRA-ké-al). The thyroid cartilage is connected to the cricoid cartilage by the cricothyroid ligament. The cricoid cartilage is the landmark for making an emergency airway called a tracheotomy (see 'Clinical connection: Tracheotomy and intubation'). The paired arytenoid cartilages (ar'-i-TE-noyd = ladlelike) are triangular pieces of mostly hyaline cartilage located at the posterior, superior border of the cricoid cartilage. They form synovial joints with the cricoid cartilage and have a wide range of mobility. The paired corniculate cartilages (kor-NIK-ia-lat = shaped like a small horn), horn-shaped pieces of elastic cartilage, are located at the apex of each arytenoid cartilage. The paired cuneiform cartilages (KU- né-i-form = wedge-shaped), club-shaped elastic cartilages anterior to the corniculate cartilages, support the vocal folds and lateral aspects of the epiglottis.

The lining of the larynx superior to the vocal folds is nonkeratinised stratified squamous epithelium. The lining of the larynx inferior to the vocal folds is pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium consisting of ciliated columnar cells, goblet cells, and basal cells. The mucous produced by the goblet cells helps trap dust not removed in the upper passages. The cilia in the upper respiratory tract move mucous and trapped particles down towards the pharynx; the cilia in the lower respiratory tract move them up towards the pharynx. CLINICAL CONNECTION Laryngitis and cancer of the larynx Laryngitis is an inflammation of the larynx that is most often caused by a respiratory infection or irritants such as cigarette smoke. Inflammation of the vocal folds causes hoarseness or loss of voice by interfering with the contrac- tion of the folds or by causing them to swell to the point acquire a permanent hoarseness from the damage done by chronic inflammation. Cancer of the larynx is found almost exclusively in individuals who smoke. The condition is characterised by hoarseness, pain on swallowing, or pain radiating to an ear. Treatment consists of radiation therapy and/or surgery. where they cannot vibrate freely. Many long-termsmokers The structures of voice production The mucous membrane of the larynx forms two pairs of folds (figure 23.4c): a superior pair called the vestibular folds (false vocal cords) and an inferior pair called the vocal folds (true vocal cords). The space 1098 Principles of anatomy and physiology © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd. Not for resale or distribution. Any unauthorised distribution or use will result in legal action. between the vestibular folds is known as the rima vestibuli. The laryngeal ventricle is a lateral expansion of the middle portion of the laryngeal cavity inferior to the vestibular folds and superior to the vocal folds (see figure 23.2b). While the vestibular folds do not function in voice production, they do have other important functional roles. When the vestibular folds are brought together, they function in holding the breath against pressure in the thoracic cavity, such as might occur when a person strains to lift a heavy object. The vocal folds are the principal structures of voice production. Deep to the mucous membrane of the vocal folds, which is nonkeratinised stratified squamous epithelium, are bands of elastic ligaments stretched between the rigid cartilages of the larynx like the strings on a guitar. Intrinsic laryngeal muscles attach to both the rigid cartilages and the vocal folds. When the muscles contract they move the cartilages, which pulls the elastic ligaments tight, and this stretches the vocal folds out into the airways so that the rima glottidis is narrowed. Contracting and relaxing the muscles varies the tension in the vocal folds, much like loosening or tightening a guitar string. Air passing through the larynx vibrates the folds and produces sound (phonation) by setting up sound waves in the column of air in the pharynx, nose, and mouth. The variation in the pitch of the sound is related to the tension in the vocal folds. The greater the pressure of air, the louder the sound produced by the vibrating vocal folds. When the intrinsic muscles of the larynx contract, they pull on the arytenoid cartilages, which causes the cartilages to pivot and slide. Contraction of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, for example, moves the vocal folds apart (abduction), thereby opening the rima glottidis (figure 23.5a). By contrast, contraction of the lateral cricoarytenoid muscles moves the vocal folds together (adduction), thereby closing the rima glottidis (figure 23.5b). Other intrinsic muscles can elongate (and place tension on) or shorten (and relax) the vocal folds. Movement of the vocal folds. The glottis consists of a pair of folds of mucous membrane in the larynx (the vocal folds) and the space between them (the rima glottidis). <-_--- Thyroid cartilage \ : Epiglottis Glottis: Vocal folds Cricoid cartilage Vocal ligament Rima glottidis Vestibular folds Cuneiform cartilage Corniculate cartilage cricoarytenoid muscle Superior view of cartilages and muscles View through a laryngoscope (a) Movement of vocal folds apart (abduction) Lateral cricoarytenoid muscle (b) Movement of vocal folds together (adduction) QUESTION What is the main function of the vocal folds? Pitch is controlled by the tension on the vocal folds. If they are pulled taut by the muscles, they vibrate more rapidly, and a higher pitch results. Decreasing the muscular tension on the vocal folds causes them to vibrate more slowly and produce lower pitched sounds. Due to the influence of androgens (male sex © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd. Not for resale or distribution. Any unauthorised distribution or use will result in legal action. hormones), vocal folds are usually thicker and longer in males than in females, and therefore they vibrate more slowly. This is why a man's voice generally has a lower range of pitch than that of a woman. Sound originates from the vibration of the vocal folds, but other structures are necessary for converting the sound into recognisable speech. The pharynx, mouth, nasal cavity, and paranasal sinuses all act as resonating chambers that give the voice its human and individual quality. We produce the vowel sounds by constricting and relaxing the muscles in the wall of the pharynx. Muscles of the face, tongue, and lips help us enunciate words. Whispering is accomplished by closing all but the posterior portion of the rima glottidis. Because the vocal folds do not vibrate during whispering, there is no pitch to this form of speech. However, we can still produce intelligible speech while whispering by changing the shape of the oral cavity as we enunciate. As the size of the oral cavity changes, its resonance qualities change, which imparts a vowel-like pitch to the air as it rushes towards the lips. Trachea The trachea (TRA-ké-a = sturdy), or windpipe, is a tubular passageway for air that is about 12 cm (5 in.) long and 2.5 cm (1 in.) in diameter. It is located anterior to the oesophagus (figure 23.6) and extends from the larynx to the superior border of the fifth thoracic vertebra (TS), where it divides into right and left primary bronchi (see figure 23.7).

The layers of the tracheal wall, from deep to superficial, are the (1) mucosa, (2) submucosa, (3) hyaline cartilage, and (4) adventitia (composed of areolar connective tissue). The mucosa of the trachea consists of an epithelial layer of pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium and an underlying layer of lamina propria that contains elastic and reticular fibres. It provides the same protection against dust as the membrane lining the nasal cavity and larynx. The submucosa consists of areolar connective tissue that contains seromucous glands and their ducts. The 16-20 incomplete, horizontal rings of hyaline cartilage resemble the letter C, are stacked one above another, and are connected by dense connective tissue. They may be felt through the skin inferior to the larynx. The open part of each C-shaped cartilage ring faces posteriorly towards the oesophagus (figure 23.6) and is spanned by a fibromuscular membrane. Within this membrane are transverse smooth muscle fibres, called the trachealis muscle (tra-ké-A-lis), and elastic connective tissue that allow the diameter of the trachea to change subtly during inhalation and exhalation, which is important in maintaining efficient airflow. The solid C-shaped cartilage rings provide a semirigid support to maintain patency so that the tracheal wall does not collapse inward (especially during inhalation) and obstruct the air passageway. The adventitia of the trachea consists of areolar connective tissue that joins the trachea to surrounding tissues. 1100 Principles of anatomy and physiology © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

CLINICAL CONNECTION Tracheotomy and intubation Several conditions may block airflow by obstructing the trachea. The rings of cartilage that support the trachea may be accidentally crushed, the mucous membrane may become inflamed and swell so much that it closes off the passageway, excess mucous secreted by inflamed membranes may clog the lower respiratory passages, a large object may be aspirated (breathed in), or a cancerous tumour may protrude into the airway. Two methods are used to reestablish airflow past a tracheal obstruction. If the obstruction is above the level of the larynx, a tracheotomy (tra-ké-O-t6-mé) may be performed. In this procedure, also called a tracheostomy, a skin incision is followed by a short longitudinal incision into the trachea below the cricoid cartilage. A tracheal tube is then inserted to create an emergency air passageway. The second method is intu- bation (in'-too-BA-shun), in which a tube is inserted into the mouth or nose and passed inferiorly through the larynx and trachea. The firm wall of the tube pushes aside any flexible obstruction, and the lumen of the tube provides a passageway for air; any mucous clogging the trachea can be suctioned out through the tube. Bronchi At the superior border of the fifth thoracic vertebra, the trachea divides into a right main (primary) bronchus (BRONG-kus = windpipe), which goes into the right lung, and a /eft main (primary) bronchus, which goes into the left lung (figure 23.7). The right main bronchus is more vertical, shorter, and wider than the left. As a result, an aspirated object is more likely to enter and lodge in the right main bronchus than the left. Like the trachea, the main bronchi (BRONG-ki) contain incomplete rings of cartilage and are lined by pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium. Branching of ays from the trachea: the bronc! tree. The bronchial tree consists of macroscopic airways that begin at the trachea and continue through the terminal bronchioles.

At the point where the trachea divides into right and left main bronchi an internal ridge called the carina (ka-RI-na = keel of a boat) is formed by a posterior and somewhat inferior projection of the last tracheal cartilage.

Any unauthorised distribution or use will result in legal action. trachea for triggering a cough reflex. Widening and distortion of the carina is a serious sign because it usually indicates a carcinoma of the lymph nodes around the region where the trachea divides. On entering the lungs, the main bronchi divide to form smaller bronchi - the lobar (secondary) bronchi, one for each lobe of the lung. (The right lung has three lobes; the left lung has two.) The lobar bronchi continue to branch, forming still smaller bronchi, called segmental (tertiary) bronchi (TER-shé-e-ré), that supply the specific bronchopulmonary segments within the lobes. The segmental bronchi then divide into bronchioles. Bronchioles in turn branch repeatedly, and the smallest ones branch into even smaller tubes called terminal bronchioles. These bronchioles contain club (Clara) cells, columnar, nonciliated cells interspersed among the epithelial cells. Club cells may protect against harmful effects of inhaled toxins and carcinogens, produce surfactant (discussed shortly), and function as stem cells (reserve cells), which give rise to various cells of the epithelium. The terminal bronchioles represent the end of the conducting zone of the respiratory system. This extensive branching from the trachea through the terminal bronchioles resembles an inverted tree and is commonly referred to as the bronchial tree. As the branching becomes more extensive in the bronchial tree, several structural changes may be noted. 1. The mucous membrane in the bronchial tree changes from pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium in the main bronchi, lobar bronchi, and segmental bronchi to ciliated simple columnar epithelium with some goblet cells in larger bronchioles, to mostly ciliated simple cuboidal epithelium with no goblet cells in smaller bronchioles, to mostly nonciliated simple cuboidal epithelium in terminal bronchioles. Recall that ciliated epithelium of the respiratory membrane removes inhaled particles in two ways. Mucous produced by goblet cells traps the particles, and the cilia move the mucous and trapped particles towards the pharynx for removal. In regions where nonciliated simple cuboidal epithelium is present, inhaled particles are removed by macrophages. 2. Plates of cartilage gradually replace the incomplete rings of cartilage in main bronchi and finally disappear in the distal bronchioles. 3. As the amount of cartilage decreases, the amount of smooth muscle increases. Smooth muscle encircles the lumen in spiral bands and helps maintain patency. However, because there is no supporting cartilage, muscle spasms can close off the airways. This is what happens during an asthma attack, which can be a life-threatening situation. During exercise, activity in the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) increases and the adrenal medulla releases the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine; both of these events cause relaxation of smooth muscle in the bronchioles, which dilates the airways. Because air reaches the alveoli more quickly, lung ventilation improves. The parasympathetic division of the ANS and mediators of allergic reactions such as histamine have the opposite effect, causing contraction of bronchiolar smooth muscle, which results in constriction of distal bronchioles. SPORT SPOTLIGHT Exercise training and the Australian bushfires of 2019-20 The Australian bushfires of 2019-20 dramatically impacted on the air quality of the east coast and millions - tralians were exposed to very poor air quality for several weeks. The immediate concern was raised for those more vulnerable groups with pre-existing respiratory disease, breathing limitations, and poor lung health. Undoubtedly, the detrimental effects of breathing in thousands of tiny air toxins was unquestionable. In the weeks to come, when it was evident that air quality would be poor for possibly months, questions were raised about the safety of healthy, active adults taking part in recreational activity and also elite athletes either training or competing in those conditions. The lungs perform many roles, beyond gas exchange, and these collectively are referred to the non-respiratory functions. As the barrier between the external and internal environments, the lungs'roles of filtering toxins and particles, and protecting against infection are critical. However, this delicate system, including ciliated epithelial tissue, immune cells, and mucous, can be overwhelmed by destruction and damage, even when the person is healthy and disease-free. Athletes will increase their ventilation, sometimes 20-25 fold, during vigorous and high-intensity training. This results in ventilation exceeding 200 L/min in athletes such as 1102 Principles of anatomy and physiology © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd. Not for resale or distribution.

In an environment of poor air quality, mass exposure to the detrimental particles in smoke-filled air can have both short- and long-term health implications. Immediate risks include bronchoconstriction (for example, asthma-like symptoms) or damage to the small airway structure that contributes to lung health and combating infection. Fortunately, the Australian Institute , with expert guidance, has provided both general and exercise-specific advice for athletes, coaches and the wider public. This mended activities that modify ventilation requirements, and physical training environments that can aid with filtering and cleaning air (for example, indoor training where possible).> Knowing the importance of maintaining a healthy and func- tioning respiratory system should encourage athletes to minimise the risks of poor air quality impacting on such a critical body system for exercise. With likely increased frequency of poor air quality in the future, not only from bushfires, these guidelines are an invaluable resource for anyone taking part in exercise when air quality deteriorates. guidance factors in measurable air quality, types of recom- CHECKPOINT 4.

How does the larynx function in respiration and voice production? 7. Describe the structure of the bronchial tree. Lungs The lungs (= lightweights, because they float) are paired cone-shaped organs in the thoracic cavity (figure 23.8). They are separated from each other by the heart and other structures of the mediastinum, which divides the thoracic cavity into two anatomically distinct chambers. As a result, if trauma causes one lung to collapse, the other may remain expanded. Each lung is enclosed and protected by a double-layered serous membrane called the pleural membrane (PLOOR-al; pleur- = side). The superficial layer, called the parietal pleura, lines the wall of the thoracic cavity; the deep layer, the visceral pleura, covers the lungs themselves (figure 23.8). Between the visceral and parietal pleurae is a small space, the pleural cavity, which contains a small amount of lubricating fluid secreted by the membranes. This pleural fluid reduces friction between the membranes, allowing them to slide easily over one another during breathing. Pleural fluid also causes the two membranes to adhere to one another just as a film of water causes two glass microscope slides to stick together, a phenomenon called surface tension. Separate pleural cavities surround the left and right lungs. Inflammation of the pleural membrane, called pleurisy or pleuritis, may in its early stages be associated with pain due to friction between the parietal and visceral layers of the pleura. If the inflammation persists, excess fluid accumulates in the pleural space, a condition known as pleural effusion. Relationship of the pleural membranes to the lungs. The parietal pleura lines the thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura covers the lungs. Transverse Plane VISCERAL PLEURA Left lung Superior Ascending aorta vena cava . Pulmonary arteries PARIETAL.

The lungs extend from the diaphragm to just slightly superior to the clavicles and lie against the ribs anteriorly and posteriorly (figure 23.9a). The broad inferior portion of the lung, the base, is concave and fits over the convex area of the diaphragm. The narrow superior portion of the lung is the apex. The surface of the lung lying against the ribs, the costal surface, matches the rounded curvature of the ribs. The mediastinal (medial) surface of each lung contains a region, the hilum, through which bronchi, pulmonary blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves enter and exit (figure 23.9e). These structures are held together by the pleura and connective tissue and constitute the root of the lung. Medially, the left lung also contains a concavity, the cardiac notch, in which the apex of the heart lies. Due to the space occupied by the heart, the left lung is about 10% smaller than the right lung. Although the right lung is thicker and broader, it is also somewhat shorter than the left lung because the diaphragm is higher on the right side, accommodating the liver that lies inferior to it.

The apex of the lungs lies superior to the medial third of the clavicles, and this is the only area that can be palpated. The anterior, lateral, and posterior surfaces of the lungs lie against the ribs. The base of the lungs extends from the sixth costal cartilage anteriorly to the spi-nous process of the tenth thoracic vertebra posteriorly. The pleura extends about 5 cm (2 in.) below the base from the sixth costal cartilage anteriorly to the twelfth rib posteriorly. Thus, the lungs do not completely fill the pleural cavity in this area. Removal of excessive fluid in the pleural cavity can be accomplished without injuring lung tissue by inserting a needle anteriorly through the seventh intercostal space, a procedure called thoracentesis (thor!-a-sen-TE-sis; -centesis = puncture). The needle is passed along the superior border of the lower rib to avoid damage to the intercostal nerves and blood vessels. Inferior to the seventh intercostal space there is danger of penetrating the diaphragm.

This collapse of a partof Lobes, fissures, and lobules One or two fissures divide each lung into lobes (figure 23.9b-e). Both lungs have an oblique fissure, which extends inferiorly and anteriorly; the right lung also has a horizontal fissure. The oblique fissure in the left lung separates the superior lobe from the inferior lobe. In the right lung, the superior part of the oblique fissure separates the superior lobe from the inferior lobe; the inferior part of the oblique fissure separates the inferior lobe from the middle lobe, which is bordered superiorly by the horizontal fissure. Each lobe receives its own lobar bronchus. Thus, the right main bronchus gives rise to three lobar bronchi called the superior, middle, and inferior lobar bronchi, and the left main bronchus gives rise to superior and inferior lobar bronchi. Within the lung, the lobar bronchi give rise to the segmental bronchi, which are constant in both origin and distribution - there are 10 segmental bronchi in each lung. The segment of lung tissue that each segmental bronchus supplies is called a bronchopulmonary segment (brong-ko- PUL-m6-nar-é). Bronchial and pulmonary disorders (such as tumours or abscesses) that are localised in a bronchopulmonary segment may be surgically removed without seriously disrupting the surrounding lung tissue. Each bronchopulmonary segment of the lungs has many small compartments called lobules; each lobule is wrapped in elastic connective tissue and contains a lymphatic vessel, an arteriole, a venule, and a branch from a terminal bronchiole (figure 23.10a). Terminal bronchioles subdivide into microscopic branches called respiratory bronchioles (figure 23.10b). They also have alveoli (described shortly) budding from their walls. Alveoli participate in gas exchange, and thus respiratory bronchioles begin the respiratory zone of the respiratory system. As the respiratory bronchioles penetrate more deeply into the lungs, the epithelial lining changes from simple cuboidal to simple squamous. Respiratory bronchioles in turn subdivide into several (2-11) alveolar ducts (al-VE-6-lar), which consist of simple squamous epithelium. The respiratory passages from the trachea to the alveolar ducts contain about 25 orders of branching; branching from the trachea into primary bronchi is called first-order branching, that from main bronchi into lobar bronchi is called second-order branching, and so on down to the alveolar ducts. © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

Alveoli Around the circumference of the alveolar ducts are numerous alveoli and alveolar sacs. An alveolus (al- VE-6-lus) is a cup-shaped outpouching lined by simple squamous epithelium and supported by a thin elastic basement membrane; an alveolar sac consists of two or more alveoli that share a common opening (figure 23.10a, b). The walls of alveoli consist of two types of alveolar epithelial cells (figure 23.11). The more numerous type J alveolar (squamous pulmonary epithelial) cells are simple squamous epithelial cells that form a nearly continuous lining of the alveolar wall. Type I alveolar cells, also called septal cells, are fewer in number and are found between type I alveolar cells. The thin type I alveolar cells are the main sites of gas exchange. Type II alveolar cells, rounded or cuboidal epithelial cells with free surfaces containing microvilli, secrete alveolar fluid, which keeps the surface between the cells and the air moist. Included in the alveolar fluid is surfactant (sur-FAK-tant), a complex mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins. Surfactant lowers the surface tension of alveolar fluid, which reduces the tendency of alveoli to collapse and thus maintains their patency (described later). Associated with the alveolar wall are alveolar macrophages (dust cells), phagocytes that remove fine dust particles and other debris from the alveolar spaces. Also present are fibroblasts that produce reticular and elastic fibres. Underlying the layer of type I alveolar cells is an elastic basement membrane. On the outer surface of the alveoli, the lobule's arteriole and venule disperse into a network of blood capillaries (see figure 23.10a) that consist of a single layer of endothelial cells and basement membrane. The exchange of O, and CO, between the air spaces in the lungs and the blood takes place by diffusion across the alveolar and capillary walls, which together form the respiratory membrane. Extending from the alveolar air space to blood plasma, the respiratory membrane consists of four layers (figure 23.1 1b): 1. a layer of type I and type I alveolar cells and associated alveolar macrophages that constitutes the alveolar wall 2. an epithelial basement membrane underlying the alveolar wall 1106 Principles of anatomy and physiology © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

Despite having several layers, the respiratory membrane is very thin - only 0.5 ym thick, about one- sixteenth the diameter of a red blood cell - to allow rapid diffusion of gases. It has been estimated that the lungs contain 300 million alveoli, providing an immense surface area of 70 m? (750 ft') - about the size of a racquetball court - for gas exchange. | FIGURE 23.11 | Structural components of an alveolus.

Blood supply to the lungs The lungs receive blood via two sets of arteries: pulmonary arteries and bronchial arteries. Deoxygenated blood passes through the pulmonary trunk, which divides into a left pulmonary artery that enters the left lung and a right pulmonary artery that enters the right lung. (The pulmonary arteries are the only arteries in the body that carry deoxygenated blood.) Return of the oxygenated blood to the heart occurs by way of the four pulmonary veins, which drain into the left atrium (see figure 21.29). A unique feature of pulmonary blood vessels is their constriction in response to localised hypoxia (low O, level). In all other body tissues, hypoxia causes dilation of blood vessels to increase blood flow. In the lungs, however, vasoconstriction in response to hypoxia diverts pulmonary blood from poorly ventilated areas of the lungs to well-ventilated regions for more efficient gas exchange. This phenomenon is known as ventilation- perfusion coupling (per-FY U-zhun) because the perfusion (blood flow) to each area of the lungs matches the extent of ventilation (airflow) to alveoli in that area. Bronchial arteries, which branch from the aorta, deliver oxygenated blood to the lungs. This blood mainly perfuses the muscular walls of the bronchi and bronchioles. Connections do exist between branches of the bronchial arteries and branches of the pulmonary arteries, however; most blood returns to the heart via pulmonary veins. Some blood drains into bronchial veins, branches of the azygos system, and returns to the heart via the superior vena cava. Patency of the respiratory system Throughout the discussion of the respiratory organs, several examples were given of structures or secretions that help to maintain patency of the system so that air passageways are kept free of obstruction. These included the bony and cartilaginous frameworks of the nose, skeletal muscles of the pharynx, cartilages of the larynx, C-shaped rings of cartilage in the trachea and bronchi, smooth muscle in the bronchioles, and surfactant in the alveoli. Unfortunately, there are also factors that can compromise patency. These include crushing injuries to bone and cartilage, a deviated nasal septum, nasal polyps, inflammation of mucous membranes, spasms of smooth muscle, and a deficiency of surfactant. A summary of the epithelial linings and special features of the organs of the respiratory system is presented in table 23.1.

The process of gas exchange in the body, called respiration, has three basic steps. 1. Pulmonary ventilation (pulmon- = lung), or breathing, is the inhalation (inflow) and exhalation (outflow) of air and involves the exchange of air between the atmosphere and the alveoli of the lungs. 2. External (pulmonary) respiration is the exchange of gases between the alveoli of the lungs and the blood in pulmonary capillaries across the respiratory membrane. In this process, pulmonary capillary blood gains O, and loses CO). 3. Internal (tissue) respiration is the exchange of gases between blood in systemic capillaries and tissue cells. In this step the blood loses O and gains CO}. Within cells, the metabolic reactions that consume O, and give off CO, during the production of ATP are termed cellular respiration (discussed in chapter 25). In pulmonary ventilation, air flows between the atmosphere and the alveoli of the lungs because of alternating pressure differences created by contraction and relaxation of respiratory muscles. The rate of airflow and the amount of effort needed for breathing are also influenced by alveolar surface tension, compliance of the lungs, and airway resistance. Pressure changes during pulmonary ventilation Air moves into the lungs when the air pressure inside the lungs is less than the air pressure in the atmosphere. Air moves out of the lungs when the air pressure inside the lungs is greater than the air pressure in the atmosphere. Inhalation Breathing in is called inhalation (inspiration). Just before each inhalation, the air pressure inside the lungs is equal to the air pressure of the atmosphere, which at sea level is about 760 millimetres of mercury (mmHg), or | atmosphere (atm). For air to flow into the lungs, the pressure inside the alveoli must become lower than the atmospheric pressure. This condition is achieved by increasing the size of the lungs. The pressure of a gas in a closed container is inversely proportional to the volume of the container. This means that if the size of a closed container is increased, the pressure of the gas inside the container decreases, and that if the size of the container is decreased, then the pressure inside it increases. This inverse relationship between volume and pressure, called Boyle's law, may be demonstrated as follows (figure 23.12): Suppose we place a gas in a cylinder that has a movable piston and a pressure gauge, and that the initial pressure created by the gas molecules striking the wall of the container is | atm. If the piston is pushed down, the gas is compressed into a smaller volume, so that the same number of gas molecules strikes less wall area. The gauge shows that the pressure doubles as the gas is compressed to half its original volume. In other words, the same number of molecules in half the volume produces twice the pressure. Conversely, if the piston is raised to increase the volume, the pressure decreases. Thus, the pressure of a gas varies inversely with volume. Differences in pressure caused by changes in lung volume force air into our lungs when we inhale and out when we exhale. For inhalation to occur, the lungs must expand, which increases lung volume and thus decreases the pressure in the lungs to below atmospheric pressure. The first step in expanding the lungs during normal quiet inhalation involves contraction of the main muscle of inhalation, the diaphragm, with resistance from external intercostals (figure 23.13). The most important muscle of inhalation is the diaphragm, the dome-shaped skeletal muscle that forms the floor of the thoracic cavity. It is innervated by fibres of the phrenic nerves, which emerge from the spinal cord at cervical levels 3, 4, and 5. Contraction of the diaphragm causes it to flatten, lowering its dome. This increases the vertical diameter of the thoracic cavity. During normal quiet inhalation, the diaphragm descends about | cm (0.4 in.), producing a pressure difference of 1-3 mmHg and the inhalation of about 500 mL of air. In strenuous breathing, the diaphragm may descend 10 cm (4 in.), which produces a pressure difference of 100 mmHg and the inhalation of 2-3 litres of air. Contraction of the diaphragm is responsible for about 75% of the air that enters the lungs during quiet breathing. Advanced pregnancy, excessive obesity, or confining abdominal clothing can prevent complete descent of the diaphragm. 1110 Principles of anatomy and physiology © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

Piston Pressure [ gauge | | Volume = 1 litre Volume = 1/2 litre Pressure = 1 atm Pressure QUESTION If the volume is decreased from 1 litre to '/, litre, how would the pressure change? Muscles of inhalation and exhalation. The pectoralis minor muscle (not shown here) is illustrated in figure 11.14a. During normal, quiet inhalation, the diaphragm and external intercostals contract, the lungs expand, and air moves into the lungs; during normal, quiet exhalation, the diaphragm and external intercostals relax and the lungs recoil, forcing air out of the lungs.

Contraction of the external intercostals is responsible for about 25% of the air that enters the lungs during normal quiet breathing. During quiet inhalations, the pressure between the two pleural layers in the pleural cavity, called intrapleural (intrathoracic) pressure, is always subatmospheric (lower than atmospheric pressure). Just before inhalation, it is about 4 mmHg less than the atmospheric pressure, or about 756 mmHg at an atmospheric pressure of 760 mmHg (figure 23.14). As the diaphragm and external intercostals contract and the overall size of the thoracic cavity increases, the volume of the pleural cavity also increases, which causes intrapleural pressure to decrease to about 754 mmHg. During expansion of the thorax, the parietal and visceral pleurae normally adhere tightly because of the subatmospheric pressure between them and because of the surface tension created by their moist adjoining surfaces. As the thoracic cavity expands, the parietal pleura lining the cavity is pulled outward in all directions, and the visceral pleura and lungs are pulled along with it. | FIGURE 23.14 | Pressure changes in pulmonary ventilatio: D uring inhalation, the diaphragm contracts, the chest expands, the lungs are pulled outward, and alveolar pressure decreases. During exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes, the lungs recoil inward, and alveolar pressure increases, forcing air out of the lungs. ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE = 760 mmHg ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE = 760 mmHg 2.

The chest and lungs recoil, the chest cavity PRESSURE = contracts, and the alveolar pressure increases above 762 mmHg atmospheric pressure. Air flows out of the lungs in response to the pressure gradient, and the lung volume decreases. During INTRAPLEURAL forced exhalations, the internal intercostals and abdominal PRESSURE = muscles contract, thereby reducing the size of the chest cavity 756 mmHg further and creating a greater increase in alveolar pressure. QUESTION How does the intrapleural pressure change during a normal, quiet breath? As the volume of the lungs increases in this way, the pressure inside the lungs, called the alveolar (intrapulmonic) pressure, drops from 760 to 758 mmHg. A pressure difference is thus established between the atmosphere and the alveoli. Because air always flows from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure, inhalation takes place. Air continues to flow into the lungs as long as a pressure difference exists. During deep, forceful inhalations, accessory muscles of inspiration also participate in increasing the size of the thoracic cavity (see figure 23.13a). The muscles are so named because they make little, if any, contribution during normal quiet inhalation, but during exercise or forced ventilation they may contract vigorously. The accessory muscles of inhalation include the sternocleidomastoid muscles, which elevate the sternum; the scalene muscles, which elevate the first two ribs; and the pectoralis minor muscles, which elevate the third through fifth ribs. Because both normal quiet inhalation and inhalation during exercise or forced ventilation involve muscular contraction, the process of inhalation is said to be active. 1112 Principles of anatomy and physiology © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd. Not for resale or distribution. Any unauthorised distribution or use will result in legal action. Exhalation Breathing out, called exhalation (expiration), is also due to a pressure gradient, but in this case the gradient is in the opposite direction: The pressure in the lungs is greater than the pressure of the atmosphere. Normal exhalation during quiet breathing, unlike inhalation, is a passive process because no muscular contractions are involved. Instead, exhalation results from elastic recoil of the chest wall and lungs, both of which have a natural tendency to spring back after they have been stretched. Two inwardly directed forces contribute to elastic recoil: (1) the recoil of elastic fibres that were stretched during inhalation and (2) the inward pull of surface tension due to the film of alveolar fluid. Exhalation starts when the inspiratory muscles relax. As the diaphragm relaxes, its dome moves superiorly owing to its elasticity. As the external intercostals relax, the ribs are depressed. These movements decrease the vertical, lateral, and anteroposterior diameters of the thoracic cavity, which decreases lung volume. In turn, the alveolar pressure increases to about 762 mmHg. Air then flows from the area of higher pressure in the alveoli to the area of lower pressure in the atmosphere (see figure 23.14). Exhalation becomes active only during forceful breathing, as occurs while playing a wind instrument or during exercise. During these times, muscles of exhalation - the abdominal and internal intercostals (see figure 23.13a) - contract, which increases pressure in the abdominal region and thorax. Contraction of the abdominal muscles moves the inferior ribs downward and compresses the abdominal viscera, thereby forcing the diaphragm superiorly. Contraction of the internal intercostals, which extend inferiorly and posteriorly between adjacent ribs, pulls the ribs inferiorly. Although intrapleural pressure is always less than alveolar pressure, it may briefly exceed atmospheric pressure during a forceful exhalation, such as during a cough. Other factors affecting pulmonary ventilation As you have just learned, air pressure differences drive airflow during inhalation and exhalation. However, three other factors affect the rate of airflow and the ease of pulmonary ventilation: surface tension of the alveolar fluid, compliance of the lungs, and airway resistance. Surface tension of alveolar fluid As noted earlier, a thin layer of alveolar fluid coats the luminal surface of alveoli and exerts a force known as surface tension. Surface tension arises at all air-water interfaces because the polar water molecules are more strongly attracted to each other than they are to gas molecules in the air. When liquid surrounds a sphere of air, as in an alveolus or a soap bubble, surface tension produces an inwardly directed force. Soap bubbles 'burst' because they collapse inward due to surface tension. In the lungs, surface tension causes the alveoli to assume the smallest possible diameter. During breathing, surface tension must be overcome to expand the lungs during each inhalation. Surface tension also accounts for two-thirds of lung elastic recoil, which decreases the size of alveoli during exhalation. The surfactant (a mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins) present in alveolar fluid reduces its surface tension below the surface tension of pure water. A deficiency of surfactant in premature infants causes respiratory distress syndrome, in which the surface tension of alveolar fluid is greatly increased, so that many alveoli collapse at the end of each exhalation. Great effort is then needed at the next inhalation to reopen the collapsed alveoli. Compliance of the lungs Compliance refers to how much effort is required to stretch the lungs and chest wall. High compliance means that the lungs and chest wall expand easily; low compliance means that they resist expansion. By analogy, a thin balloon that is easy to inflate has high compliance, and a heavy and stiff balloon that takes a lot of effort to inflate has low compliance. In the lungs, compliance is related to two principal factors: elasticity and surface tension. The lungs normally have high compliance and expand easily because elastic fibres in lung tissue are easily stretched and surfactant in alveolar fluid reduces surface tension. Decreased compliance is a common feature in pulmonary conditions that (1) scar lung tissue (for example, tuberculosis), (2) cause lung tissue to become filled with fluid (pulmonary oedema), (3) produce a deficiency in surfactant, or (4) impede lung expansion in any way (for example, paralysis of the intercostal muscles). Nevertheless, increased lung compliance occurs in emphysema (see 'Disorders: Homeostatic imbalances' at the end of the chapter) due to destruction of elastic fibres in alveolar walls and therefore poor elastic recoil. © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

CLINICAL CONNECTION Tuberculosis and airflow obstruction: importance of treatment Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) involves a slow, progressive destruction of lung tissue and inher- ent obstruction of airflow through the lower conducting airways. Cigarette smoking is a known risk factor for the development of COPD but other environmental and occu- pational particles can also contribute to the development of the disease. For individuals who develop progressive decline in lung function, simple activities of daily living become impossible to achieve as supply of oxygen to the body's tissues becomes limited. In the most severe cases, patients require continual oxygen therapy to live. COPD is a disease associated with older adults following a specific long-term exposure to a pollutant. Obstruction of respiratory lung airflow is also associated with untreated lung infection. Of particular concern is tuberculosis (TB). TB is an infection that can lead to long- term lung tissue damage if not treated successfully and often requires more than one antibiotic. When exposure to TB occurs early in life, this can have long-term respiratory consequences. In a recent study, including Australian researchers from the University , lung function was assessed in a population of low socioeconomic individuals living , Peru.° The study compared those who had known drug susceptible or multi-drug resistance TB to a matched control group who were also living . Interestingly, although clinically cured, the patients who had previous TB demonstrated poorer lung function compared to the controls. The cured 'drug susceptible' TB patients had airflow difficulties while those with 'multi-drug ~ 'ae resistance' TB not only had airflow issues but also a reducedlung volume. Both reduced lung volume and air- flowobstruction are indicators of reduced lung function and therefore limit the successful ventilation of the alveoli. The study's findings indicate that an early diagnosis and successful treatment is critical for minimising the long-term damage. TB rates and New Zealand are some of the lowest in the world and cases are regarded as serious when they arise. Airway resistance Like the flow of blood through blood vessels, the rate of airflow through the airways depends on both the pressure difference and the resistance: airflow equals the pressure difference between the alveoli and the atmosphere divided by the resistance. The walls of the airways, especially the bronchioles, offer some resistance to the normal flow of air into and out of the lungs. As the lungs expand during inhalation, the bronchioles enlarge because their walls are pulled outward in all directions. Larger diameter airways have decreased resistance. Airway resistance then increases during exhalation as the diameter of bronchioles decreases. Airway diameter is also regulated by the degree of contraction or relaxation of smooth muscle in the walls of the airways. Signals from the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system cause relaxation of this smooth muscle, which results in bronchodilation and decreased resistance. Any condition that narrows or obstructs the airways increases resistance, so that more pressure is required to maintain the same airflow. The hallmark of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - emphysema or chronic bronchitis - is increased airway resistance due to obstruction or collapse of airways. Breathing patterns and modified breathing movements The term for the normal pattern of quiet breathing is eupnea (a@p-NE-a; eu- = good, easy, or normal; -pnea = breath). Eupnea can consist of shallow, deep, or combined shallow and deep breathing. A pattern of shallow (chest) breathing, called costal breathing, consists of an upward and outward movement of the chest due to contraction of the external intercostal muscles. A pattern of deep (abdominal) breathing, called diaphragmatic breathing (di! -a-frag-MAT-ik), consists of the outward movement of the abdomen due to the contraction and descent of the diaphragm. 1114 Principles of anatomy and physiology © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

Breathing also provides humans with methods for expressing emotions such as laughing, sighing, and sobbing and can be used to expel foreign matter from the lower air passages through actions such as sneezing and coughing. Breathing movements are also modified and controlled during talking and singing. Some of the modified breathing movements that express emotion or clear the airways are listed in table 23.2. All of these movements are reflexes, but some of them also can be initiated voluntarily. TABLE 23.2 Modified breathing movements A deep inhalation through the widely opened mouth producing an exaggerated depression of the mandible. It may be stimulated by drowsiness, or someone else's yawning, but the precise cause remains open and the vocal folds vibrate; accompanied by characteristic facial expressions and Movement Coughing A long-drawn and deep inhalation followed by a complete closure of the rima glottidis, which results in a strong exhalation that suddenly pushes the rima glottidis open and sends a blast of air through the upper respiratory passages. Stimulus for this reflex act may be a foreign body lodged in the larynx, trachea, or epiglottis. Sneezing Spasmodic contraction of muscles of exhalation that forcefully expels air through the nose and mouth. Stimulus may be an irritation of the nasal mucosa. Sighing A long-drawn and deep inhalation immediately followed by a shorter but forceful exhalation. Yawning is unknown. Sobbing Aseries of convulsive inhalations followed by a single prolonged exhalation. The rima glottidis closes earlier than normal after each inhalation so only a little air enters the lungs with each inhalation. Crying An inhalation followed by many short convulsive exhalations, during which the rima glottidis tears. Laughing The same basic movements as crying, but the rhythm of the movements and the facial expres- sions usually differ from those of crying. Laughing and crying are sometimes indistinguishable. Hiccupping Spasmodic contraction of the diaphragm followed by a spasmodic closure of the rima glottidis, which produces a sharp sound on inhalation. Stimulus is usually irritation of the sensory nerve endings of the gastrointestinal tract. Valsalva Forced exhalation against a closed rima glottidis as may occur during periods of straining while (val-SAL-va) defecating. manoeuver Pressurising the middle ear The nose and mouth are held closed and air from the lungs is forced through the auditory tube into the middle ear. Employed by those snorkelling or scuba diving during descent to equalise the pressure of the middle ear with that of the external environment. CLINICAL CONNECTION Respiratory muscle training for COPD patients Obstructive disorders are broadly characterised by alter- ations to the conducting airways, increasing the resis- tance and making rate of airflow difficult to achieve. In 2011-12 , the number of hospitalisations for COPD approached 60 000. Although deaths have reduced since the 1970s, there is increased need to improve quality of life in those people now living longer. As airways narrow and the lungs become obstructed from air ventilating the lungs, the effort to breathe, even at rest, can become laborious and difficult. Ventilation of the lungs requires basic principles of pressure and volume, and this work is greater for people with COPD due to the obstruction to airflow. Like any skeletal muscle, respiratory muscles are not protected from fatigue. Resistive breathing devices are used with the person in resting state, usually sitting down, and breathing through the mouth piece. The effort required to inhale or exhale can be adjusted to target the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Studies in patients are now demonstrating that specific inspiratory and expiratory muscle training stimu- lates the respiratory muscle function. In COPD patients, the respiratory training effects are now underpinning improve- ment to exercise tolerance and reduced effort of breathing. The impact of stronger and less fatigable respiratory mus- cles can potentially mean that people living with COPD can improve their quality of life and carry out more activities of daily living on their own.' © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

Describe how alveolar surface tension, compliance, and airway resistance affect breathing. 15. Demonstrate the various types of modified breathing movements. 23.3 Lung volumes and capacities LEARNING OBJECTIVE 23.3 Differentiate between the different lung volumes and capacities. While at rest, a healthy adult averages 12 breaths a minute, with each inhalation and exhalation moving about 500 mL of air into and out of the lungs. The volume of one breath is called the tidal volume (V7). The minute ventilation (MV) - the total volume of air inhaled and exhaled each minute - is respiratory rate multiplied by tidal volume. MV = 12 breaths/min x 500 mL/breath = 6 litres/min A lower than normal minute ventilation usually is a sign of pulmonary malfunction. The apparatus commonly used to measure the volume of air exchanged during breathing and the respiratory rate is a spirometer (spi-ROM-e-ter; spiro- = breathe; -meter = measuring device) or respirometer (res! -pi-ROM- e-ter). The record is called a spirogram. Inhalation is recorded as an upward deflection, and exhalation is recorded as a downward deflection (figure 23.15). Spirogram of lung volumes and capacities. | FIGURE 29.15 | T he average values for a healthy adult male and female are indicated, with the values for a female in parentheses.

LUNG CAPACITIES (combinations of lung volumes) QUESTION A 19-year-old male student has a vital capacity of 5 L, tidal volume of 0.5 L, inspiratory capacity of 3.5 L, and functional residual capacity of 2.5 L. What is his expiratory reserve volume? Tidal volume varies considerably from one person to another and in the same person at different times. In a typical adult, about 70% of the tidal volume (350 mL) actually reaches the respiratory zone of the respiratory system - the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli - and participates in external respiration. The other 30% (150 mL) remains in the conducting airways of the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and terminal bronchioles. Collectively, the conducting airways with air that does not undergo respiratory exchange are known as the anatomic (respiratory) dead space. (An easy rule of thumb for determining the volume of your anatomic dead space is that it is about the same in milliliters as your ideal weight in pounds.) Not all of the minute ventilation can be used 1116 Principles of anatomy and physiology © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd. Not for resale or distribution. Any unauthorised distribution or use will result in legal action. in gas exchange because some of it remains in the anatomic dead space. The alveolar ventilation rate is the volume of air per minute that actually reaches the respiratory zone. In the example just given, alveolar ventilation rate would be 350 mL/breath x 12 breaths/min = 4200 mL/min. Several other lung volumes are defined relative to forceful breathing. In general, these volumes are larger in males, taller individuals, and younger adults, and smaller in females, shorter individuals, and the elderly. Various disorders also may be diagnosed by comparison of actual and predicted normal values for a patient's gender, height, and age. The values given here are averages for young adults. By taking a very deep breath, you can inhale a good deal more than 500 mL. This additional inhaled air, called the inspiratory reserve volume, is about 3100 mL in an average adult male and 1900 mL in an average adult female (figure 23.15). Even more air can be inhaled if inhalation follows forced exhalation. If you inhale normally and then exhale as forcibly as possible, you should be able to push out considerably more air in addition to the 500 mL of tidal volume. The extra 1200 mL in males and 700 mL in females is called the expiratory reserve volume. The forced expiratory volume in I second (FEV, g) is the volume of air that can be exhaled from the lungs in | second with maximal effort following a maximal inhalation. Typically, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) greatly reduces FEV , because COPD increases airway resistance. Even after the expiratory reserve volume is exhaled, considerable air remains in the lungs because the subatmospheric intrapleural pressure keeps the alveoli slightly inflated, and some air remains in the noncollapsible airways. This volume, which cannot be measured by spirometry, is called the residual volume (re-ZID-u-al) and amounts to about 1200 mL in males and 1100 mL in females. If the thoracic cavity is opened, the intrapleural pressure rises to equal the atmospheric pressure and forces out some of the residual volume. The air remaining is called the minimal volume. Minimal volume provides a medical and legal tool for determining whether a baby is born dead (stillborn) or died after birth. The presence of minimal volume can be demonstrated by placing a piece of lung in water and observing if it floats. Foetal lungs contain no air, so the lung of a stillborn baby will not float in water. Lung capacities are combinations of specific lung volumes (figure 23.15). Inspiratory capacity is the sum of tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume (500 mL + 3100 mL = 3600 mL in males and 500 mL + 1900 mL = 2400 mL in females). Functional residual capacity is the sum of residual volume and expiratory reserve volume (1200 mL + 1200 mL = 2400 mL in males and 1100 mL + 700 mL = 1800 mL in females). Vital capacity is the sum of inspiratory reserve volume, tidal volume, and expiratory reserve volume (4800 mL in males and 3100 mL in females). Finally, total lung capacity is the sum of vital capacity and residual volume (4800 mL + 1200 mL = 6000 mL in males and 3100 mL + 1100 mL = 4200 mL in females). SPORT SPOTLIGHT The 'athlete' soldier and respiratory function Carrying a load, like a heavy backpack, is common in many recreational activities such as hiking and long-distance trekking. There are also many occupations that require staff to carry heavy loads on the torso including firefighters, park rangers and Defence Force personnel. Soldiers will carry on average 20 kilograms of equipment and body protection, and sometimes more than 50 kilograms as required to survive for extended durations. These loads are most often carried around the torso as a backpack and body armour arrangement. Walking or marching with the excessive mass requires a dramatic increase in energy. Therefore to meet the demands, the respiratory system must be able to increase the ventilation of the alveoli to achieve successful oxygen uptake. Therein lies the physiological conundrum! The increased respiratory ventilation requires that the rib Researchers at the University have been cage be further expanded to increase the tidal volume of | conducting a series of studies to quantify the impact of each breath.

Carrying the load on the torso did not reduce maximal aerobic power, however, it did reduce the total time participants could sustain exercise. Most interest- ingly, as the backpack arrangement restricted the ribcage, breathing frequency was favoured over tidal volume (depth) in order to achieve the required ventilation to exercise. Ratings of dsypnea were also increased during load car- riage; this was also partly evident during chest strapping, demonstrating that the load carried around the torso restricts the movement of the ribs during inhalation. For a soldier conducting their daily duties, the requirement of carrying very heavy loads on the torso means that the respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm, the external intercostal, and the accessory muscle of respirations, must work harder in order to achieve the necessary lung ven- tilation. Further research is underway to identify potential respiratory training techniques to enhance the 'athlete' soldier capacity to carry very heavy loads. CHECKPOINT 16. What is a spirometer? 17.

Define alveolar ventilation rate and FEV; 9. 23.4 Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide LEARNING OBJECTIVE 23.4 Understand the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, including the involvement 's and Henry's laws. The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between alveolar air and pulmonary blood occurs via passive diffusion, which is governed by the behaviour of gases as described by two gas laws, Dalton's law and Henry's law. Dalton's law is important for understanding how gases move down their pressure gradients by diffusion, and Henry's law helps explain how the solubility of a gas relates to its diffusion. Gas laws: Dalton's law and Henry's law According 's law, each gas in a mixture of gases exerts its own pressure as if no other gases were present. The pressure of a specific gas in a mixture is called its partial pressure (P,); the subscript is the chemical formula of the gas. The total pressure of the mixture is calculated simply by adding all of the partial pressures. Atmospheric air is a mixture of gases - nitrogen (N,), oxygen (O}), argon (Ar), carbon dioxide (CO), variable amounts of water vapour (H,O), plus other gases present in small quantities. Atmospheric pressure is the sum of the pressures of all of these gases: Atmospheric pressure (760 mmHg) =Py, +Po, + Pa, + Puyo + Peo, + Pother gases We can determine the partial pressure exerted by each component in the mixture by multiplying the percentage of the gas in the mixture by the total pressure of the mixture. Atmospheric air is 78.6% nitrogen, 20.9% oxygen, 0.093% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and 0.06% other gases; a variable amount of water vapour is also present. The amount of water varies from practically 0% over a desert to 4% over the ocean, to about 0.4% on a cool, dry day. Thus, the partial pressures of the gases in inhaled air are as follows. Py, = 0.786 x 760 mmHg = 597.4 mmHg Po, = 0.209 x 760 mmHg = 158.8 mmHg Py, = 0.0009 x 760 mmHg = 0.7 mmHg Pio = 0.003 x 760 mmHg = 2.3 mmHg Poo, = 0.0004 x 760 mmHg = 0.3 mmHg Pother gases = 9.0006 x 760 mmHg = 0.5 mmHg Total = 760.0 mmHg These partial pressures determine the movement of O, and CO, between the atmosphere and lungs, between the lungs and blood, and between the blood and body cells. Each gas diffuses across a permeable 1118 Principles of anatomy and physiology © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd. Not for resale or distribution. Any unauthorised distribution or use will result in legal action. membrane from the area where its partial pressure is greater to the area where its partial pressure is less. The greater the difference in partial pressure, the faster the rate of diffusion. Compared with inhaled air, alveolar air has less O7 (13.6% versus 20.9%) and more CO, (5.2% versus 0.04%) for two reasons. First, gas exchange in the alveoli increases the CO, content and decreases the O, content of alveolar air. Second, when air is inhaled it becomes humidified as it passes along the moist mucosal linings. As water vapour content of the air increases, the relative percentage that is O, decreases. In contrast, exhaled air contains more O, than alveolar air (16% versus 13.6%) and less CO, (4.5% versus 5.2%) because some of the exhaled air was in the anatomic dead space and did not participate in gas exchange. Exhaled air is a mixture of alveolar air and inhaled air that was in the anatomic dead space. Henry's law states that the quantity of a gas that will dissolve in a liquid is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas and its solubility. In body fluids, the ability of a gas to stay in solution is greater when its partial pressure is higher and when it has a high solubility in water. The higher the partial pressure of a gas over a liquid and the higher the solubility, the more gas will stay in solution. In comparison to oxygen, much more CO, is dissolved in blood plasma because the solubility of CO, is 24 times greater than that of O,. Even though the air we breathe contains mostly N5, this gas has no known effect on bodily functions, and at sea level pressure very little of it dissolves in blood plasma because its solubility is very low. An everyday experience gives a demonstration 's law. You have probably noticed that a soft drink makes a hissing sound when the top of the container is removed, and bubbles rise to the surface for some time afterwards. The gas dissolved in carbonated beverages is CO. Because the soft drink is bottled or canned under high pressure and capped, the CO, remains dissolved as long as the container is unopened. Once you remove the cap, the pressure decreases and the gas begins to bubble out of solution. Henry's law explains two conditions resulting from changes in the solubility of nitrogen in body fluids. Even though the air we breathe contains about 79% nitrogen, this gas has no known effect on bodily functions, and very little of it dissolves in blood plasma because of its low solubility at sea level pressure. As the total air pressure increases, the partial pressures of all of its gases increase. When a scuba diver breathes air under high pressure, the nitrogen in the mixture can have serious negative effects. Because the partial pressure of nitrogen is higher in a mixture of compressed air than in air at sea level pressure, a considerable amount of nitrogen dissolves in plasma and interstitial fluid. Excessive amounts of dissolved nitrogen may produce giddiness and other symptoms similar to alcohol intoxication. The condition is called nitrogen narcosis or 'rapture of the deep'. Ifa diver comes to the surface slowly, the dissolved nitrogen can be eliminated by exhaling it. However, if the ascent is too rapid, nitrogen comes out of solution too quickly and forms gas bubbles in the tissues, resulting in decompression sickness (the bends). The effects of decompression sickness typically result from bubbles in nervous tissue and can be mild or severe, depending on the number of bubbles formed. Symptoms include joint pain, especially in the arms and legs, dizziness, shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, paralysis, and unconsciousness.

External and internal respiration External respiration or pulmonary gas exchange is the diffusion of O, from air in the alveoli of the lungs to blood in pulmonary capillaries and the diffusion of CO, in the opposite direction (figure 23.16a). External respiration in the lungs converts deoxygenated blood (depleted of some O) coming from the right side of the heart into oxygenated blood (saturated with O,) that returns to the left side of the heart (see figure 21.29). As blood flows through the pulmonary capillaries, it picks up O, from alveolar air and unloads CO, into alveolar air. Although this process is commonly called an 'exchange' of gases, each gas diffuses independently from the area where its partial pressure is higher to the area where its partial pressure is lower. © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd. Not for resale or distribution. Any unauthorised distribution or use will result in legal action. As figure 23.16a shows, O, diffuses from alveolar air, where its partial pressure is 105 mmHg, into the blood in pulmonary capillaries, where Po, is only 40 mmHg in a resting person. If you have been exercising, the Po, will be even lower because contracting muscle fibres are using more Oj. Diffusion continues until the Po, of pulmonary capillary blood increases to match the Po, of alveolar air, 105 mmHg. Because blood leaving pulmonary capillaries near alveolar air spaces mixes with a small volume of blood that has flowed through conducting portions of the respiratory system, where gas exchange does not occur, the Po, of blood in the pulmonary veins is slightly less than the Po, in pulmonary capillaries, about 100 mmHg. While O, is diffusing from alveolar air into deoxygenated blood, CO, is diffusing in the opposite direction. The Peo, of deoxygenated blood is 45 mmHg in a resting person, and the Pcg, of alveolar air is 40 mmHg. Because of this difference ,: carbon dioxide diffuses from deoxygenated blood into the alveoli until the Peo, of the blood decreases to 40 mmHg. Exhalation keeps alveolar Peo, at 40 mmHg. Oxygenated blood returning to the left side of the heart in the pulmonary veins thus has , of 40 mmHg. 7 Changes in partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide (in mmHg) during external and internal respiration.

Not for resale or distribution. Any unauthorised distribution or use will result in legal action. The number of capillaries near alveoli in the lungs is very large, and blood flows slowly enough through these capillaries that it picks up a maximal amount of O,. During vigorous exercise, when cardiac output is increased, blood flows more rapidly through both the systemic and pulmonary circulations. As a result, blood's transit time in the pulmonary capillaries is shorter. Still, the Po, of blood in the pulmonary veins normally reaches 100 mmHg. In diseases that decrease the rate of gas diffusion, however, the blood may not come into full equilibrium with alveolar air, especially during exercise. When this happens, the Po, declines and Pc, rises in systemic arterial blood. The left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood into the aorta and through the systemic arteries to systemic capillaries. The exchange of O, and CO, between systemic capillaries and tissue cells is called internal respiration or systemic gas exchange (figure 23.16b). As O, leaves the bloodstream, oxygenated blood is converted into deoxygenated blood. Unlike external respiration, which occurs only in the lungs, internal respiration occurs in tissues throughout the body. The Po, of blood pumped into systemic capillaries is higher (100 mmHg) than the Po, in tissue cells (40 mmHg at rest) because the cells constantly use O, to produce ATP. Due to this pressure difference, oxygen diffuses out of the capillaries into tissue cells and blood Po, drops to 40 mmHg by the time the blood exits systemic capillaries. While O, diffuses from the systemic capillaries into tissue cells, CO, diffuses in the opposite direction. Because tissue cells are constantly producing CO), the Peo, of cells (45 mmHg at rest) is higher than that of systemic capillary blood (40 mmHg). As a result, CO, diffuses from tissue cells through interstitial fluid into systemic capillaries until the Pco, in the blood increases to 45 mmHg. The deoxygenated blood then returns to the heart and is pumped to the lungs for another cycle of external respiration. In a person at rest, tissue cells, on average, need only 25% of the available O, in oxygenated blood; despite its name, deoxygenated blood retains 75% of its O, content. During exercise, more O, diffuses from the blood into metabolically active cells, such as contracting skeletal muscle fibres. Active cells use more O, for ATP production, causing the O, content of deoxygenated blood to drop below 75%. The rate of pulmonary and systemic gas exchange depends on several factors. * Partial pressure difference of the gases. Alveolar Po, must be higher than blood Po, for oxygen to diffuse from alveolar air into the blood. The rate of diffusion is faster when the difference between Po, in alveolar air and pulmonary capillary blood is larger; diffusion is slower when the difference is smaller. The differences between Po, and Pcg, in alveolar air versus pulmonary blood increase during exercise. The larger partial pressure differences accelerate the rates of gas diffusion. The partial pressures of O, and CO, in alveolar air also depend on the rate of airflow into and out of the lungs. Certain drugs (such as morphine) slow ventilation, thereby decreasing the amount of O, and CO, that can be exchanged between alveolar air and blood. With increasing altitude, the total atmospheric pressure decreases, as does the partial pressure of O, - from 159 mmHg at sea level, to 110 mmHg at 10 000 ft, to 73 mmHg at 20,000 ft. Although O, still is 20.9% of the total, the Po, of inhaled air decreases with increasing altitude. Alveolar Po, decreases correspondingly, and O, diffuses into the blood more slowly. The common signs and symptoms of high altitude sickness - shortness of breath, headache, fatigue, insomnia, nausea, and dizziness - are due to a lower level of oxygen in the blood. ¢ Surface area available for gas exchange. As you learned earlier in the chapter, the surface area of the alveoli is huge (about 70 m2 or 750 ft"). In addition, many capillaries surround each alveolus, so many that as much as 900 mL of blood is able to participate in gas exchange at any instant. Any pulmonary disorder that decreases the functional surface area of the respiratory membranes decreases the rate of external respiration. In emphysema (see 'Disorders: Homeostatic imbalances' at the end of the chapter), for example, alveolar walls disintegrate, so surface area is smaller than normal and pulmonary gas exchange is slowed. ¢ Diffusion distance. The respiratory membrane is very thin, so diffusion occurs quickly. Also, the capillaries are so narrow that the red blood cells must pass through them in single file, which minimises the diffusion distance from an alveolar air space to haemoglobin inside red blood cells. Buildup of interstitial fluid between alveoli, as occurs in pulmonary oedema (see 'Disorders: Homeostatic imbalances' at the end of the chapter), slows the rate of gas exchange because it increases diffusion distance. ¢ Molecular weight and solubility of the gases. Because O, has a lower molecular weight than CO, it could be expected to diffuse across the respiratory membrane about 1.2 times faster. However, the solubility of CO, in the fluid portions of the respiratory membrane is about 24 times greater than that of O,. Taking both of these factors into account, net outward CO, diffusion occurs 20 times more rapidly than net inward O, diffusion. Consequently, when diffusion is slower than normal - for example, © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd. Not for resale or distribution.

CLINICAL CONNECTION Hypoxia Hypoxia (hI-POK-sé-a; hypo- = under) is a deficiency of O, at the tissue level. Based on the cause, we can classify hypoxia into four types, as follows. 1. Hypoxic hypoxia is caused by a low Po, in arterial blood as a result of high altitude, airway obstruction, or fluid in the lungs. 2. In anaemic hypoxia, too little functioning haemoglobin is present in the blood, which reduces O, transport 3. In ischemic hypoxia (is-KE-mik), blood flow to a tissue is so reduced that too little O, is delivered to it, even though P,, and oxyhaemoglobin levels are normal. 4. In histotoxic hypoxia (his-t6-TOK-sik), the blood delivers adequate O, to tissues, but the tissues are unable to use it properly because of the action of some toxic agent. One cause is cyanide poisoning, in which cyanide blocks an enzyme required for the use of O, during ATP synthesis. to tissue cells. Among the causes are hemorrhage, anaemia, and failure of haemoglobin to carry its normal complement , as in carbon monoxide poisoning. CHECKPOINT 20.

What are the diffusion paths of oxygen and carbon dioxide during external and internal respiration? 23. What factors affect the rate of diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide? 23.5 Transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide LEARNING OBJECTIVE 23.5 Describe how the blood transports oxygen and carbon dioxide. As you have already learned, the blood transports gases between the lungs and body tissues. When O, and CO, enter the blood, certain chemical reactions occur that aid in gas transport and gas exchange. Oxygen transport Oxygen does not dissolve easily in water, so only about 1.5% of inhaled O, is dissolved in blood plasma, which is mostly water. About 98.5% of blood O, is bound to haemoglobin in red blood cells (figure 23.17). Each 100 mL of oxygenated blood contains the equivalent of 20 mL of gaseous O5. Using the percentages just given, the amount dissolved in the plasma is 0.3 mL and the amount bound to haemoglobin is 19.7 mL. The haem portion of haemoglobin contains four atoms of iron, each capable of binding to a molecule of O, (see figure 19.4b, c). Oxygen and haemoglobin bind in an easily reversible reaction to form oxyhaemoglobin. Binding of O Hb + OJ Hb-O, Reduced haemoglobin Oxygen _ Dissociation Oxyhaemoglobin (deoxy haemoglobin) of O, The 98.5% of the O, that is bound to haemoglobin is trapped inside RBCs, so only the dissolved O, (1.5%) can diffuse out of tissue capillaries into tissue cells. Thus, it is important to understand the factors that promote O, binding to and dissociation (separation) from haemoglobin. The relationship between haemoglobin and oxygen partial pressure The most important factor that determines how much O, binds to haemoglobin is the Po,; the higher the Po, the more O, combines with Hb. When reduced haemoglobin (Hb) is completely converted to oxyhaemoglobin (Hb-O,), the haemoglobin is said to be fully saturated; when haemoglobin consists of a mixture and Hb-O,, it is partially saturated. The per cent saturation of haemoglobin expresses the average saturation of haemoglobin with oxygen. For instance, if each haemoglobin molecule has bound two O, molecules, then the haemoglobin is 50% saturated because each Hb can bind a maximum of four O). 1122 Principles of anatomy and physiology © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

The relationship between the per cent saturation of haemoglobin and Po, is illustrated in the oxygen- haemoglobin dissociation curve in figure 23.18. Note that when the Po, is high, haemoglobin binds with large amounts of O, and is almost 100% saturated. When Po, is low, haemoglobin is only partially saturated. In other words, the greater the Po,, the more O) will bind to haemoglobin, until all the available haemoglobin molecules are saturated. Therefore, in pulmonary capillaries, where Po, is high, a lot of O, binds to haemoglobin. In tissue capillaries, where the Po, is lower, haemoglobin does not hold as much O, and the dissolved O) is unloaded via diffusion into tissue cells (see figure 23.17b). Note that haemoglobin is still 75% saturated with O, at , of 40 mmHg, the average Po, of tissue cells in a person at rest. This is the basis for the earlier statement that only 25% of the available O, unloads from haemoglobin and is used by tissue cells under resting conditions. © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

In your pulmonary veins if you were jogging? When the Po, is between 60 and 100 mmHg, haemoglobin is 90% or more saturated with O7 (figure 23.18). Thus, blood picks up a nearly full load of O, from the lungs even when the Po, of alveolar air is as low as 60 mmHg. The Hb-Po, curve explains why people can still perform well at high altitudes or when they have certain cardiac and pulmonary diseases, even though Po, may drop as low as 60 mmHg. Note also in the curve that at a considerably lower Po, of 40 mmHg, haemoglobin is still 75% saturated with O,. However, oxygen saturation drops to 35% at 20 mmHg. Between 40 and 20 mmHg, large amounts of O, are released from haemoglobin in response to only small decreases ,. In active tissues such as contracting muscles, Po, may drop well below 40 mmHg. Then, a large percentage of the O, is released from haemoglobin, providing more O, to metabolically active tissues. Other factors affecting the affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen Although Po, is the most important factor that determines the per cent Oy saturation of haemoglobin, several other factors influence the tightness or affinity with which haemoglobin binds O). In effect, these factors shift the entire curve either to the left (higher affinity) or to the right (lower affinity). The changing affinity of haemoglobin for O, is another example of how homeostatic mechanisms adjust body activities to cellular needs. Each one makes sense if you keep in mind that metabolically active tissue cells need O, and produce acids, CO,, and heat as wastes. The following four factors affect the affinity of haemoglobin for Op. 1. Acidity (pH). As acidity increases (pH decreases), the affinity of haemoglobin for O, decreases, and O, dissociates more readily from haemoglobin (figure 23.19a). In other words, increasing acidity enhances the unloading of oxygen from haemoglobin. The main acids produced by metabolically active tissues are lactic acid and carbonic acid. When pH decreases, the entire oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve shifts to the right; at any given Po, , Hb is less saturated with 05, a change termed the Bohr effect (BOR). The Bohr effect works both ways: an increase in H* in blood causes O, to unload from haemoglobin, and the binding of O, to haemoglobin causes unloading of H* from haemoglobin. The explanation for the Bohr effect is that haemoglobin can act as a buffer for hydrogen ions (H*). But when H* ions bind to amino acids in haemoglobin, they alter its structure slightly, decreasing its oxygen-carrying capacity. Thus, lowered pH drives O, off haemoglobin, making more O, available for tissue cells. By contrast, elevated pH increases the affinity of haemoglobin for O, and shifts the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve to the left. 1124 Principles of anatomy and physiology © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd. Not for resale or distribution. Any unauthorised distribution or use will result in legal action. 2. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide. CO, also can bind to haemoglobin, and the effect is similar to that of H* (shifting the curve to the right). As Peo, rises, haemoglobin releases O7 more readily (figure 23.19b). Peg, and pH are related factors because low blood pH (acidity) results from high Pco,. As CO) enters the blood, much of it is temporarily converted to carbonic acid (H,CO3), a reaction catalysed by an enzyme in red blood cells called carbonic anhydrase (CA). co, +H,O-2H,Co, = Ht + HCO; Carbon - Water Carbonic Hydrogen Bicarbonate dioxide acid ion ion The carbonic acid thus formed in red blood cells dissociates into hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions. As the H* concentration increases, pH decreases. Thus, an increased Po, produces a more acidic environment, which helps release O, from haemoglobin. During exercise, lactic acid - a by-product of anaerobic metabolism within muscles - also decreases blood pH. Decreased Pco, (and elevated pH) shifts the saturation curve to the left. 3. Temperature. Within limits, as temperature increases, so does the amount of O, released from haemoglobin (figure 23.20). Heat is a by-product of the metabolic reactions of all cells, and the heat released by contracting muscle fibres tends to raise body temperature. Metabolically active cells require more O, and liberate more acids and heat. The acids and heat in turn promote release of O, from oxyhaemoglobin. Fever produces a similar result. In contrast, during hypothermia (lowered body temperature) cellular metabolism slows, the need for O, is reduced, and more O, remains bound to haemoglobin (a shift to the left in the saturation curve). 4. BPG. A substance found in red blood cells called 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) (bis'-fos-f6-GLIS- e-rat), previously called diphosphoglycerate (DPG), decreases the affinity of haemoglobin for O and thus helps unload O, from haemoglobin. BPG is formed in red blood cells when they break down glucose to produce ATP in a process called glycolysis (described in section 25.3). When BPG combines with haemoglobin by binding to the terminal amino groups of the two beta globin chains, the haemoglobin binds O, less tightly at the haem group sites. The greater the level of BPG, the more O, is unloaded from haemoglobin. Certain hormones, such as thyroxine, human growth hormone, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and testosterone, increase the formation of BPG. The level of BPG also is higher in people living at higher altitudes. Oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curves showing the relationship of (a) pH and (b) Pco, to haemoglobin saturation at normal body temperature. As pH increases , decreases, O2 combines more tightly with haemoglobin, so that less is available to tissues. The broken lines emphasise these relationships. As pH decreases , increases, the affinity of haemoglobin for O2 declines, so less Oo combines with haemoglobin and more is available to tissues. 100 - High blood pH 100 + Low blood & < S gol (76) 5 gob Peo. 2 xe} £ 80+ 3 80+ 8 70- Normal blood pH S 70+ Normal blood os 6 60L (7.4) 5S 60L Poos c< 2 sob Low blood pH 5 sob High blood g 3S P, 2 40h (7.2) 5 4b | C2 oO = 30F 2 sob oO 1 Cc 1 : 20+ 8 204 ! 2 40 a toh 0 pe 0 pea 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Po, (mmHg) Po, (mmHg) (a) Effect of pH on affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen (b) Effect , on affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen QUESTION In comparison to the value when you are sitting, is the affinity of your haemoglobin for O, higher or lower when you are exercising?

Why? Oxygen affinity of foetal and adult haemoglobin Foetal haemoglobin (Hb-F) differs from adult haemoglobin (Hb-A) in structure and in its affinity for O. Hb-F has a higher affinity for O) because it binds BPG less strongly. Thus, when Po, is low, Hb-F can carry up to 30% more O, than maternal Hb-A (figure 23.21). As the maternal blood enters the placenta, O, is readily transferred to foetal blood. This is very important because the O, saturation in maternal blood in the placenta is quite low, and the foetus might suffer hypoxia were it not for the greater affinity of foetal haemoglobin for O).

CLINICAL CONNECTION Carbon monoxide poisoning Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless and odourless gas found in exhaust fumes from automobiles, gas furnaces and space heaters, and in tobacco smoke. It is a by- product of the combustion of carbon-containing materials such as coal, gas, and wood. CO binds to the haem group of haemoglobin, just as O, does, except that the binding of carbon monoxide to haemoglobin is over 200 times as strong as the binding of O, to haemoglobin. Thus, at a will combine with half the available haemoglobin molecules and reduce the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood by 50%. Elevated blood levels of CO cause carbon monoxide poisoning, which can cause the lips and oral mucosa to appear bright, cherry-red (the colour of haemoglobin with carbon monoxide bound to it). Without prompt treatment, carbon monoxide poisoning is fatal. It is possible to rescue a victim of CO poisoning by administering pure oxygen, which speeds up the separation of carbon monoxide from concentration as small as 0.1% (Pgq = 0.5 mmHg), CO haemoglobin. Carbon dioxide transport Under normal resting conditions, each 100 mL of deoxygenated blood contains the equivalent of 53 mL of gaseous CO}, which is transported in the blood in three main forms (see figure 23.17). 1. Dissolved CO}. The smallest percentage - about 7% - is dissolved in blood plasma. On reaching the lungs, it diffuses into alveolar air and is exhaled. 2. Carbamino compounds. A somewhat higher percentage, about 23%, combines with the amino groups of amino acids and proteins in blood to form carbamino compounds (kar-BAM-i-n6). Because the most prevalent protein in blood is haemoglobin (inside red blood cells), most of the CO, transported in this manner is bound to haemoglobin. The main CO) binding sites are the terminal amino acids in the two alpha and two beta globin chains. Haemoglobin that has bound CO, is termed carbaminohaemoglobin (Hb-CO)). Hb + Haemoglobin The formation of carbaminohaemoglobin is greatly influenced ,. For example, in tissue capillaries Peg, is relatively high, which promotes formation of carbaminohaemoglobin. But in pulmonary capillaries, Peo, is relatively low, and the CO, readily splits apart from globin and enters the alveoli by diffusion. 3. Bicarbonate ions. The greatest percentage of CO, - about 70% - is transported in blood plasma as bicarbonate ions (HCO;_) (bi/-KAR-bo-nat). As CO, diffuses into systemic capillaries and enters red blood cells, it reacts with water in the presence of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) to form carbonic acid, which dissociates into H* and HCO;~. cA Co, Carbon dioxide Hb-CO, Carbaminohaemoglobin =- = CO, +H,O == H,CO, == H* + HCO, Carbon - Water Carbonic Hydrogen -_ Bicarbonate dioxide acid ion ion Thus, as blood picks up CO,, HCO;" accumulates inside RBCs. Some HCO; moves out into the blood plasma, down its concentration gradient. In exchange, chloride ions (CI-) move from plasma into the RBCs. This exchange of negative ions, which maintains the electrical balance between blood plasma and RBC cytosol, is known as the chloride shift (see figure 23.22b). The net effect of these reactions is that CO) is removed from tissue cells and transported in blood plasma as HCO, . As blood passes through pulmonary capillaries in the lungs, all of these reactions reverse and CO, is exhaled. The amount of CO, that can be transported in the blood is influenced by the per cent saturation of haemoglobin with oxygen. The lower the amount of oxyhaemoglobin (Hb-O,), the higher the CO,- carrying capacity of the blood, a relationship known as the Haldane effect. Two characteristics of deoxyhaemoglobin give rise to the Haldane effect: (1) Deoxyhaemoglobin binds to and thus transports more CO, than does Hb-O). (2) Deoxyhaemoglobin also buffers more H* than does Hb-O3, thereby removing H* from solution and promoting conversion of CO, to HCO3" via the reaction catalysed by carbonic anhydrase. Summary of gas exchange and transport in lungs and tissues Deoxygenated blood returning to the pulmonary capillaries in the lungs (figure 23.22a) contains CO dissolved in blood plasma, CO, combined with globin as carbaminohaemoglobin (Hb--CO,), and CO, incorporated into HCO;" within RBCs.

As blood passes through the pulmonary capillaries, molecules of CO, dissolved in blood plasma and CO, that dissociates from the globin portion of haemoglobin diffuse into alveolar air and are exhaled. At the same time, inhaled O, is diffusing from alveolar air into RBCs and is binding to haemoglobin to form oxyhaemoglobin (Hb-O,). Carbon dioxide also is released from HCO;" when H* combines with HCO; inside RBCs. The HCO formed from this reaction then splits into CO, which is exhaled, and H,O. As the concentration of HCO; declines inside RBCs in pulmonary capillaries, HCO," diffuses in from the blood plasma, in exchange for Cl". In sum, oxygenated blood leaving the lungs has increased O, content and decreased amounts of CO, and H*. In systemic capillaries, as cells use O, and produce CO), the chemical reactions reverse (figure 23.22b). Summary of ch al reactions that occur during ga hange. (a) As carbon dioxide (COz) is exhaled, haemoglobin (Hb) inside red blood cells in pulmonary capillaries unloads CO, and picks from alveolar air. Binding -H releases hydrogen ions (H*). Bicarbonate ions (HCO3~) pass into the RBC and bind to released H*, forming carbonic acid (H,CO3). The H,CO, dissociates into water (HO) and CO,, and the CO. diffuses from blood into alveolar air. To maintain electrical balance, a chloride ion (CI) exits the RBC for each HCO,~ that enters (reverse chloride shift). (b) CO, diffuses out of tissue cells that produce it and enters red blood cells, where some of it binds to haemoglobin, forming carbaminohaemoglobin (Hb-CO,). This reaction causes O, to dissociate from oxyhaemoglobin (Hb-O,). Other molecules of CO, combine with water to produce bicarbonate ions (HCO3~) and hydrogen ions (H*). As Hb buffers Ht, the Hb releases O, (Bohr effect). To maintain electrical balance, a chloride ion (CI-) enters the RBC for each HCO3~ that exits (chloride shift).

Why can haemoglobin unload more oxygen as blood flows through capillaries of metabolically active tissues, such as skeletal muscle during exercise, than is unloaded at rest? 23.6 Control of breathing LEARNING OBJECTIVE 23.6 Explain how the nervous system controls breathing. At rest, about 200 mL of O, is used each minute by body cells. During strenuous exercise, however, O, use typically increases 15- to 20-fold in normal healthy adults, and as much as 30-fold in elite endurance- trained athletes. Several mechanisms help match breathing effort to metabolic demand. Respiratory centre The size of the thorax is altered by the action of the breathing muscles, which contract as a result of nerve impulses transmitted from centres in the brain and relax in the absence of nerve impulses. These nerve impulses are sent from clusters of neurons located bilaterally in the brain stem. This widely dispersed group of neurons, collectively called the respiratory centre, can be divided into two principal areas on the basis of location and function: (1) the medullary respiratory centre in the medulla oblongata and (2) the pontine respiratory group in the pons (figure 23.23). Medullary respiratory centre The medullary respiratory centre is made up of two collections of neurons called the dorsal respiratory group (DRG), formerly called the inspiratory area, and the ventral respiratory group (VRG), formerly called the expiratory area. During normal quiet breathing, neurons of the DRG generate impulses to the diaphragm via the phrenic nerves and the external intercostal muscles via the intercostal nerves (figure 23.24a). These impulses are released in bursts, which begin weakly, increase in strength for about two seconds, and then stop altogether. When the nerve impulses reach the diaphragm and external intercostals, the muscles contract and inhalation occurs. When the DRG becomes inactive after two seconds, the diaphragm and external intercostals relax for about three seconds, allowing the passive recoil of the lungs and thoracic wall. Then, the cycle repeats itself. Located in the VRG is a cluster of neurons called the pre-Bétzinger complex (BOT-zin-ger) that is believed to be important in the generation of the rhythm of breathing (see figure 23.23a). This rhythm generator, analogous to the one in the heart, is composed of pacemaker cells that set the basic rhythm of breathing. The exact mechanism of these pacemaker cells is unknown and is the topic of much ongoing research. However, it is thought that the pacemaker cells provide input to the DRG, driving the rate at which DRG neurons fire action potentials. The remaining neurons of the VRG do not participate in normal quiet breathing. The VRG becomes activated when forceful breathing is required, such as during exercise, when playing a wind instrument, or at high altitudes. During forceful inhalation (figure 23.24b), nerve impulses from the DRG not only stimulate the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles to contract, they also activate neurons of the VRG involved in forceful inhalation to send impulses to the accessory muscles of inhalation (sternocleidomastoid, scalenes, and pectoralis minor). Contraction of these muscles results in forceful inhalation. During forceful exhalation (figure 23.24b), the DRG is inactive along with the neurons of the VRG that result in forceful inhalation, but neurons of the VRG involved in forceful exhalation send nerve impulses to the accessory muscles of exhalation (internal intercostals, external oblique, internal oblique, transversus abdominis, and rectus abdominis). Contraction of these muscles results in forceful exhalation. © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd. Not for resale or distribution. Any unauthorised distribution or use will result in legal action.

Pontine respiratory group The pontine respiratory group (PRG) (PON-tén), formerly called the pneumotaxic area, is a collection of neurons in the pons (see figure 23.23a). The neurons in the PRG are active during inhalation and exhalation. The PRG transmits nerve impulses to the DRG in the medulla. The PRG may play a role in both inhalation and exhalation by modifying the basic rhythm of breathing generated by the VRG, as when exercising, speaking, or sleeping. CHECKPOINT 27. How does the medullary respiratory centre regulate breathing? 28. How is the pontine respiratory group related to the control of breathing?

Cortical influences on breathing Because the cerebral cortex has connections with the respiratory centre, we can voluntarily alter our pattern of breathing. We can even refuse to breathe at all for a short time. Voluntary control is protective because it enables us to prevent water or irritating gases from entering the lungs. The ability to not breathe, however, is limited by the buildup of CO and H* in the body. When Pco, and H" concentrations increase to a certain level, the DRG neurons of the medullary respiratory centre are strongly stimulated, nerve impulses are sent along the phrenic and intercostal nerves to inspiratory muscles, and breathing resumes, whether the person wants it to or not. It is impossible for small children to kill themselves by voluntarily holding their breath, even though many have tried in order to get their way. If breath is held long enough to cause fainting, breathing resumes when consciousness is lost. Nerve impulses from the hypothalamus and limbic system also stimulate the respiratory centre, allowing emotional stimuli to alter breathing as, for example, in laughing and crying. Chemoreceptor regulation of breathing Certain chemical stimuli modulate how quickly and how deeply we breathe. The respiratory system functions to maintain proper levels of CO, and O, and is very responsive to changes in the levels of these gases in body fluids. We introduced sensory neurons that are responsive to chemicals, calle chemoreceptors (ké/-m6-ré-SEP-tors), in chapter 21. Chemoreceptors in two locations of the respiratory system monitor levels of CO, H*, and O, and provide input to the respiratory centre (figure 23.25). Central chemoreceptors are located in or near the medulla oblongata in the central nervous system. They respon to changes in H* concentration ,> or both, in cerebrospinal fluid. Peripheral chemoreceptors are located in the aortic bodies, clusters of chemoreceptors located in the wall of the arch of the aorta, and in the carotid bodies, which are oval nodules in the wall of the left and right common caroti arteries where they divide into the internal and external carotid arteries. (The chemoreceptors of the aortic bodies are located close to the aortic baroreceptors, and the carotid bodies are located close to the caroti sinus baroreceptors. Recall from chapter 21 that baroreceptors are sensory receptors that monitor bloo pressure.) These chemoreceptors are part of the peripheral nervous system and are sensitive to changes ,, H*, and Pco, in the blood. Axons of sensory neurons from the aortic bodies are part of the vagus (X) nerves, and those from the carotid bodies are part of the right and left glossopharyngeal (IX) nerves. © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

Because CO, is lipid-soluble, it easily diffuses into cells where, in the presence of carbonic anhydrase, it combines with water (H,O) to form carbonic acid (H,CO3). Carbonic acid quickly breaks down into H* and HCO 3°. Thus, an increase in CO, in the blood causes an increase in H* inside cells, and a decrease in CO, causes a decrease in H*. 1132 Principles of anatomy and physiology © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

If even a slight increase , occurs - a condition called hypercapnia (hi! -per-KAP-né-a) or hypercarbia - the central chemoreceptors are stimulated and respond vigorously to the resulting increase in H* level. The peripheral chemoreceptors also are stimulated by both the high Pco, and the rise in H*. In addition, the peripheral chemoreceptors (but not the central chemoreceptors) respond to a deficiency of O,. When Po, in arterial blood falls from a normal level of 100 mmHg but is still above 50 mmHg, the peripheral chemoreceptors are stimulated. Severe deficiency of O, depresses activity of the central chemoreceptors and DRG, which then do not respond well to any inputs and send fewer impulses to the muscles of inhalation. As the breathing rate decreases or breathing ceases altogether, Po, falls lower and lower, establishing a positive feedback cycle with a possibly fatal result. The chemoreceptors participate in a negative feedback system that regulates the levels of CO, O>, and H* in the blood (figure 23.26). As a result of increased Poo, decreased pH (increased H*), or decreased Po, input from the central and peripheral chemoreceptors causes the DRG to become highly active, and the rate and depth of breathing increase. Rapid and deep breathing, called hyperventilation, allows the inhalation of more O, and exhalation of more CO, until Peg, and H* are lowered to normal. If arterial Peo, is lower than 40 mmHg - a condition called hypocapnia or hypocarbia - the central and peripheral chemoreceptors are not stimulated, and stimulatory impulses are not sent to the DRG. As a result, DRG neurons set their own moderate pace until CO, accumulates and the Pco, rises to 40 mmHg. DRG neurons are more strongly stimulated when Pco, is rising above normal than when Po, is falling below normal. As a result, people who hyperventilate voluntarily and cause hypocapnia can hold their breath for an unusually long period. Swimmers were once encouraged to hyperventilate just before diving in to compete. However, this practice is risky because the O, level may fall dangerously low and cause fainting before the Pco, rises high enough to stimulate inhalation. If you faint on land you may suffer bumps and bruises, but if you faint in the water you could drown. Proprioceptor stimulation of breathing As soon as you start exercising, your rate and depth of breathing increase, even before changes ,, P¢o,, or H* level occur. The main stimulus for these quick changes in respiratory effort is input from proprioceptors, which monitor movement of joints and muscles. Nerve impulses from the proprioceptors stimulate the DRG of the medulla. At the same time, axon collaterals (branches) of upper motor neurons that originate in the primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus) also feed excitatory impulses into the DRG. The inflation reflex Similar to those in the blood vessels, stretch-sensitive receptors called baroreceptors or stretch receptors are located in the walls of bronchi and bronchioles. When these receptors become stretched during overinflation of the lungs, nerve impulses are sent along the vagus (X) nerves to the dorsal respiratory group (DRG) in the medullary respiratory centre. In response, the DRG is inhibited and the diaphragm and external intercostals relax. As a result, further inhalation is stopped and exhalation begins. As air leaves the lungs during exhalation, the lungs deflate and the stretch receptors are no longer stimulated. Thus, the DRG is no longer inhibited, and a new inhalation begins. This reflex is referred to as the inflation reflex -Breuer reflex (HER-ing BROY-er). In infants, the reflex appears to function in normal breathing. In adults, however, the reflex is not activated until tidal volume (normally 500 mL) reaches more than 1500 mL. Therefore, the reflex in adults is a protective mechanism that prevents excessive inflation of the lungs, for example, during severe exercise, rather than a key component in the normal control of breathing. Other influences on breathing Other factors that contribute to regulation of breathing include the following. ¢ Limbic system stimulation. Anticipation of activity or emotional anxiety may stimulate the limbic system, which then sends excitatory input to the DRG, increasing the rate and depth of breathing. ¢ Temperature. An increase in body temperature, as occurs during a fever or vigorous muscular exercise, increases the rate of breathing. A decrease in body temperature decreases breathing rate. A sudden cold stimulus (such as plunging into cold water) causes temporary apnea (AP-né-a; a- = without; -pnea = breath), an absence of breathing. ¢ Pain. A sudden, severe pain brings about brief apnea, but a prolonged somatic pain increases breathing rate. Visceral pain may slow the rate, and alter depth, of breathing. ¢ Stretching the anal sphincter muscle. This action increases the breathing rate and is sometimes used to stimulate respiration in a newborn baby or a person who has stopped breathing. © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

Physical or chemical irritation of the pharynx or larynx brings about an immediate cessation of breathing followed by coughing or sneezing. ¢ Blood pressure. The carotid and aortic baroreceptors that detect changes in blood pressure have a small effect on breathing. A sudden rise in blood pressure decreases the rate of breathing, and a drop in blood pressure increases the breathing rate. | FIGURE 23.26 | Regulation of breathing in response to changes in blood Peco,» 3 and pH (H*) via negative feedback control.

How do the cerebral cortex, levels of CO, and Oz, proprioceptors, inflation reflex, temperature changes, pain, and irritation of the airways modify breathing? 23.7 Exercise and the respiratory system LEARNING OBJECTIVE 23.7 Describe the effects of exercise on the respiratory system. The respiratory and cardiovascular systems make adjustments in response to both the intensity and duration of exercise. The effects of exercise on the heart are discussed in chapter 20. Here we focus on how exercise affects the respiratory system. Recall that the heart pumps the same amount of blood to the lungs as to all the rest of the body. Thus, as cardiac output rises, the blood flow to the lungs, termed pulmonary perfusion, increases as well. In addition, the O, diffusing capacity, a measure of the rate at which O, can diffuse from alveolar air into the blood, may increase threefold during maximal exercise because more pulmonary capillaries become maximally perfused. As a result, there is a greater surface area available for diffusion of O, into pulmonary blood capillaries. When muscles contract during exercise, they consume large amounts of O, and produce large amounts of CO,. During vigorous exercise, 0, consumption and breathing both increase dramatically. At the onset of exercise, an abrupt increase in breathing is followed by a more gradual increase. With moderate exercise, the increase is due mostly to an increase in the depth of breathing rather than to increased breathing rate. When exercise is more strenuous, the frequency of breathing also increases. The abrupt increase in breathing at the start of exercise is due to neural changes that send excitatory impulses to the dorsal respiratory group (DRG) of the medullary respiratory centre in the medulla. These changes include (1) anticipation of the activity, which stimulates the limbic system; (2) sensory impulses from proprioceptors in muscles, tendons, and joints; and (3) motor impulses from the primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus). The more gradual increase in breathing during moderate exercise is due to chemical and physical changes in the bloodstream, including (1) slightly decreased Po,, due to increased O, consumption; (2) slightly increased Pco,: due to increased CO, production by contracting muscle fibres; and (3) increased temperature, due to liberation of more heat as more Oj is utilised. During strenuous exercise, HCO; buffers H* released by lactic acid in a reaction that liberates CO, which further increases P¢o,. © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd. Not for resale or distribution. Any unauthorised distribution or use will result in legal action. At the end of an exercise session, an abrupt decrease in breathing is followed by a more gradual decline to the resting level. The initial decrease is due mainly to changes in neural factors when movement stops or slows; the more gradual phase reflects the slower return of blood chemistry levels and temperature to the resting state. CLINICAL CONNECTION Effects of smoking on the respiratory the movement of cilia and destroy cilia in the lining of system the respiratory system. Thus, excess mucous and foreign debris are not easily removed, which further adds to the dif- ficulty in breathing. The irritants can also convert the normal respiratory epithelium into stratified squamous epithelium, which lacks cilia and goblet cells. (6) With time, smoking leads to destruction of elastic fibres in the lungs and is the prime cause of emphysema (described in 'Disorders: Homeostatic imbalances' at the end of the chapter). These changes cause collapse of small bronchioles and trapping of air in alveoli at the end of exhalation. The result is less efficient gas exchange. Smoking may cause a person to become easily 'winded' during even moderate exercise because several factors decrease respiratory efficiency in smokers. (1) Nicotine constricts terminal bronchioles, which decreases airflow into and out of the lungs. (2) Carbon monoxide in smoke binds to haemoglobin and reduces its oxygen-carrying capability. (3) Irritants in smoke cause increased mucous secretion by the mucosa of the bronchial tree and swelling of the mucosal lining, both of which impede airflow into and out of the lungs. (4) Irritants in smoke also inhibit CHECKPOINT 30. How does exercise affect the DRG? 23.8 Development of the respiratory system LEARNING OBJECTIVE 23.8 Describe the development of the respiratory system. The development of the mouth and pharynx is discussed in chapter 24. Here we consider the development of the other structures of the respiratory system that you learned about in this chapter. At about 4 weeks of development, the respiratory system begins as an outgrowth of the foregut (precursor of some digestive organs) just inferior to the pharynx. This outgrowth is called the respiratory diverticulum (di-ver-TIK-a-lum) bud (figure 23.27). The endoderm lining the respiratory diverticulum gives rise to the epithelium and glands of the trachea, bronchi, and alveoli. Mesoderm surrounding the respiratory diverticulum gives rise to the connective tissue, cartilage, and smooth muscle of these structures. The epithelial lining of the /arynx develops from the endoderm of the respiratory diverticulum; the cartilages and muscles originate from the fourth and sixth pharyngeal arches, swellings on the surface of the embryo (see figure 29.13). As the respiratory diverticulum elongates, its distal end enlarges to form a globular tracheal bud, which gives rise to the trachea. Soon after, the tracheal bud divides into bronchial buds, which branch repeatedly and develop with the bronchi. By 24 weeks, 17 orders of branches have formed and respiratory bronchioles have developed. During weeks 6 to 16, all major elements of the Jungs have formed, except for those involved in gaseous exchange (respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli). Since breathing is not possible at this stage, foetuses born during this time cannot survive. During weeks 16 to 26, lung tissue becomes highly vascular and respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and some primitive alveoli develop. Although it is possible for a foetus born near the end of this period to survive if given intensive care, death frequently occurs due to the immaturity of the respiratory and other systems. 1136 Principles of anatomy and physiology © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

From 26 weeks to birth, many more primitive alveoli develop; they consist of type I alveolar cells (main sites of gaseous exchange) and type II surfactant-producing cells. Blood capillaries also establish close contact with the primitive alveoli. Recall that surfactant is necessary to lower surface tension of alveolar fluid and thus reduce the tendency of alveoli to collapse on exhalation. Although surfactant production begins by 20 weeks, it is present in only small quantities. Amounts sufficient to permit survival of a premature (preterm) infant are not produced until 26 to 28 weeks' gestation. Infants born before 26 to 28 weeks are at high risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), in which the alveoli collapse during exhalation and must be reinflated during inhalation (see 'Clinical connection: Respiratory distress syndrome' in section 23.2). At about 30 weeks, mature alveoli develop. However, it is estimated that only about one-sixth of the full complement of alveoli develop before birth; the remainder develop after birth during the first 8 years. As the lungs develop, they acquire their pleural sacs. The visceral pleura and the parietal pleura develop from mesoderm. The space between the pleural layers is the pleural cavity. During development, breathing movements of the foetus cause the aspiration of fluid into the lungs. This fluid is a mixture of amniotic fluid, mucous from bronchial glands, and surfactant. At birth, the lungs are about half-filled with fluid. When breathing begins at birth, most of the fluid is rapidly reabsorbed by blood and lymph capillaries and a small amount is expelled through the nose and mouth during delivery. CHECKPOINT 31. What structures develop from the laryngotracheal bud? 23.9 Ageing and the respiratory system LEARNING OBJECTIVE 23.9 Describe the effects of ageing on the respiratory system. With advancing age, the airways and tissues of the respiratory tract, including the alveoli, become less elastic and more rigid; the chest wall becomes more rigid as well. The result is a decrease in lung capacity. In fact, vital capacity (the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled after maximal inhalation) can © John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.
